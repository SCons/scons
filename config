/*
 * MANIFEST: use of SCons in project config file to build itself
 *
 * SCons has a Repository feature, introduced in SCons 0.09, that was
 * designed to work well with Aegis.
 */

/*
 * The build_command field of the project config file is used to invoke
 * the relevant build command.  This command tells SCons where to find
 * the rules.
 *
 * Our chicken-and-egg dilemma is this: we want to use the version of
 * SCons under development in an Aegis change to build itself.  But the
 * pieces of SCons are likely only partly in this change, and partly in
 * baselines.
 *
 * Python only imports things on a module-by-module basis--which is to
 * say, once it finds __init__.py in a given directory, it assumes that
 * all other files in that module are in the same directory.  But that's
 * not the way Aegis works, because if a file hasn't changed on the
 * branch, it will only be in its parent's baseline directory.
 *
 * Aegis' mechanism for working around this sort of problem is to make
 * symlinks to the proper baseline versions of each file, which makes
 * it look like everything is in the local tree.  That's unattractive,
 * though, because we really want to eat our own dog food and use the
 * SCons -Y options to pull things from the baseline repositories.
 *
 * So our solution (suggested by Anthony Roach) is a bootstrap.py script
 * that does some Aegis-like searching through the baseline directories
 * and makes a bootstrap copy of the version of SCons under development
 * that we can use for building.  After it makes this copy of SCons, it
 * executes it with the same command-line arguments we supplied (and
 * setting $SCONS_LIB_DIR to the right directory) so we can use it
 * here with command-line options as if it were SCons itself.  (Note,
 * however, that bootstrap.py only understands the specific command-line
 * options already in use here, so if you change the call below to add
 * some other SCons options, you may have to modify bootstrap.py to
 * recognize them.
 *
 * The ${Source bootstrap.py} substitution finds bootstrap.py wherever
 * it may be in the Aegis baselines.
 *
 * The long -Y${SUBSTitute...} substitution takes the Aegis baseline
 * search path and turns it into the right -Y command-line options for
 * SCons.
 *
 * The rest of the substitutions (${DEVeloper}, etc.) should be obvious.
 *
 * Look in aesub(5) for more information about command substitutions.

 *
 * MANIFEST: example of using rcs in the project config file
 *
 * The entries for the commands are listed below.  RCS uses a slightly
 * different model than aegis wants, so some maneuvering is required.
 * The command strings in this section assume that the RCS commands ci and co
 * and rcs and rlog are in the command search PATH, but you may like to
 * hard-wire the paths, or set PATH at the start of each.  You should also note
 * that the strings are always handed to the Bourne shell to be executed, and
 * are set to exit with an error immediately a sub-command fails.
 *
 * In these commands, the RCS file is kept unlocked, since only the owner will
 * be checking changes in.  The RCS functionality for coordinating shared
 * access is not required.
 *
 * One advantage of using RCS version 5.6 or later is that binary files are
 * supported, should you want to have binary files in the baseline.
 *
 * The ${quote ...} construct is used to quote filenames which contain
 * shell special characters.  A minimum of quoting is performed, so if
 * the filenames do not contail shell special characters, no quotes will
 * be used.
