 * MANIFEST: example use of make in project config file
 *
 * The make(1) program exists in many forms, usually one is available with each
 * UNIX version.  The one used in the writing of this section is GNU Make 3.70,
 * avaiable by anonymous FTP from your nearest GNU archive site.  GNU Make was
 * chosen because it was the most powerful, it is widely avaiable (usually for
 * little or no cost) and discussion of the alternatives (SunOS make, BSD 4.3
 * make, etc), would not be universally applicable.  "Plain vanilla" make
 * (with no transitive closure, no pattern rules, no functions) is not
 * sufficiently capable to satisfy the demands placed on it by aegis.
 *
 * As mentioned in the Dependency Maintenance Tool chapter of the User Guide,
 * make is not really sufficient, because it lacks dynamic include dependencies.
 * However, GNU Make has a form of dynamic include dependencies, and it has a
 * few quirks, but mostly works well.
 *
 * The other feature lacking in make is a search path.  While GNU Make has
 * functionality called VPATH, the implementation leaves something to be
 * desired, and can't be used for the search path functionality required by
 * aegis.  Because of this, the create_symlinks_before_build field of the
 * project config file is set to true so that aegis will arrange for the
 * development directory to be fiull of symbolic links, making it appear that
 * the entire project is in each change's development directory.
 */

/*
 * The build_command field of the project config file is used to invoke the
 * relevant build command.  This command tells make where to find the rules.
 * The ${s Makefile} expands to a path into the baseline during development
 * if the file is not in the change.  Look in aesub(5) for more information
 * about command substitutions.

/*
 * Another field to be set in this file is one which tells aegis to maintain

 * that development builds do not attempt to write their results onto the
 * read-only versions in the baseline.

 *
 * MANIFEST: example of using rcs in the project config file
 *
 * The entries for the commands are listed below.  RCS uses a slightly
 * different model than aegis wants, so some maneuvering is required.
 * The command strings in this section assume that the RCS commands ci and co
 * and rcs and rlog are in the command search PATH, but you may like to
 * hard-wire the paths, or set PATH at the start of each.  You should also note
 * that the strings are always handed to the Bourne shell to be executed, and
 * are set to exit with an error immediately a sub-command fails.
 *
 * In these commands, the RCS file is kept unlocked, since only the owner will
 * be checking changes in.  The RCS functionality for coordinating shared
 * access is not required.
 *
 * One advantage of using RCS version 5.6 or later is that binary files are
 * supported, should you want to have binary files in the baseline.
 *
 * The ${quote ...} construct is used to quote filenames which contain
 * shell special characters.  A minimum of quoting is performed, so if
 * the filenames do not contail shell special characters, no quotes will
 * be used.
