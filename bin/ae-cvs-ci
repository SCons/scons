# MANIFEST: shell script to commit changes to CVS
#
# It is assumed that your CVSROOT and CVS_RSH environment variables have
# already been set appropriately.
#
# This script is expected to be run as by integrate_pass_notify_command
# and as such the baseline has already assumed the shape asked for by
# the change.
#
#	integrate_pass_notify_command =
#    	    "$bin/ae-cvs-ci $project $change";
#
# Alternatively, you may wish to tailor this script to the individual
# needs of your project.  Make it a source file, e.g. "etc/ae-cvs-ci.sh"
# and then use the following:
#
#	integrate_pass_notify_command =
#    	    "$sh ${s etc/ae-cvs-ci} $project $change";

# Now we need to extract the sources from Aegis and drop them into the
# CVS work area.  There are two ways to do this.
#
# The first way is to use the generated tarball.
# This has the advantage that it has the Makefile.in file in it, and
# will work immediately.
#
# The second way is to use aetar, which will give exact sources, and
# omit all derived files.  This will *not* include the Makefile.in,
# and so will not be readily compilable.

# If any new directories have been created we will need to add them
# to CVS before we can add the new files which we know are in them,
# or they would not have been created.  Do this only if the -n option
# isn't used, because if it is, we won't have actually checked out the
# source and we'd erroneously report that all of them need to be added.
