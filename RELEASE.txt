A new SCons release, 4.1.0, is now available
on the SCons download page:

      https://scons.org/pages/download.html


Here is a summary of the changes since 4.1.0:

NEW FUNCTIONALITY
-----------------

    - Add support for the (TARGET,SOURCE,TARGETS,SOURCES,CHANGED_TARGETS,CHANGED_SOURCES}.relpath property.
      This will provide a path relative to the top of the build tree (where the SConstruct is located)
      Fixes #396

DEPRECATED FUNCTIONALITY
------------------------
    - Deprecate Python 3.5 as a supported version.

- List anything that's been deprecated since the last release

CHANGED/ENHANCED EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY
---------------------------------------

    - SCons now supports the command-line parameter `--hash-format` to override the default
      hash format that SCons uses. It can also be set via `SetOption('hash_format')`. Supported
      values are: `md5`, `sha1`, and `sha256`. For all hash formats other than
      the default of `md5`, the SConsign database will include the name of the hash format.
      For example, `--hash-format=sha256` will create a SConsign with name
      `.sconsign_sha256.dblite.`.
    - Improve Subst()'s logic to check for proper callable function or class's argument list.
      It will now allow callables with expected args, and any extra args as long as they
      have default arguments. Additionally functions with no defaults for extra arguments
      as long as they are set using functools.partial to create a new callable which set them.
    - Internal has_key methods removed from SCons' dictionary-like objects
      SubstitutionEnvironment and OverrideEnvironment - in other words,
      an env - to match Python 3 which no longer has dict.has_key.
    - Removed long-deprecated construction variables PDFCOM, WIN32_INSERT_DEF,
      WIN32DEFPREFIX, WIN32DEFSUFFIX, WIN32EXPPREFIX, WIN32EXPSUFFIX.
      All have been replaced by other names since at least 1.0.

    - Added CACHEDIR_CLASS construction variable and expanded CacheDir method args
      to support SCons invoking CacheDir derived classes for CacheDir customization.
      Moved copy_from_cache attribute from the Environment class to CacheDir class.
      Code contributed by MongoDB.

FIXES
-----

    - The command-line parameter `--md5-chunksize` is now deprecated. Use `--hash-chunksize`
      instead.
    - Fix Issue #3906 - `IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES` was not properly disabled when
      set to any string value (For example ['none','false','no','off'])
      Also previously 'All' wouldn't have the desired affect.


IMPROVEMENTS
------------

- List improvements that wouldn't be visible to the user in the
  documentation:  performance improvements (describe the circumstances
  under which they would be observed), or major code cleanups

PACKAGING
---------

- List changes in the way SCons is packaged and/or released

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

- List any significant changes to the documentation (not individual
