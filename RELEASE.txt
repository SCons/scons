==================================================================

A new SCons release, 4.7.1, is now available on the SCons download page:

    https://scons.org/pages/download.html


Here is a summary of the changes since 4.7.0:

NEW FUNCTIONALITY
-----------------

- List new features (presumably why a checkpoint is being released)

DEPRECATED FUNCTIONALITY
------------------------

- List anything that's been deprecated since the last release

CHANGED/ENHANCED EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY
---------------------------------------

- Dump() with json format selected now recognizes additional compound types
  (UserDict and UserList), which improves the detail of the display.
  json output is also sorted, to match the default display.
- Python 3.13 changes the behavior of isabs() on Windows. Adjust SCons
  usage of this in NodeInfo classes to avoid test problems.
- Drop duplicated __getstate__ and __setstate__ methods in AliasNodeInfo,
  FileNodeInfo and ValueNodeInfo classes, as they are identical to the
  ones in parent NodeInfoBase and can just be inherited.
- All exceptions during the execution of an Action are now returned by value
  rather than by raising an exception, for more consistent behavior.
  NOTE: With this change, user created Actions should now catch and handle
  expected exceptions (whereas previously many of these were silently caught
  and suppressed by the SCons Action exection code).

FIXES
-----

- OSErrors are now no longer hidden during the execution of Actions.

IMPROVEMENTS
------------

- Building with msvc will no longer cause the cl/link tools to flood the
  command line with bloat. Any cl/link error messages erroneously filtered
  to stdout will now be properly redirected to stderr.

PACKAGING
---------

- List changes in the way SCons is packaged and/or released


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

- Updated Value Node docs.
- Update manpage for Tools, and for the TOOL variable.



DEVELOPMENT
-----------

- Documentation build now properly passes through skipping the PDF
  (and EPUB) builds of manpage and user guide; this can also be done
  manually if directly calling doc/man/SConstruct and doc/user/SConstruct
  by adding SKIP_PDF=1. This should help with distro packaging of SCons,
  which now does not need "fop" and other tools to be set up in order to
  build pdf versions which are then ignored.
