==================================================================

A new SCons release, X.Y.Z, is now available on the SCons download page:

    https://scons.org/pages/download.html

Here is a summary of the changes since 4.9.1:


NEW FUNCTIONALITY
-----------------

- List new features (presumably why a checkpoint is being released)

DEPRECATED FUNCTIONALITY
------------------------

- List anything that's been deprecated since the last release

CHANGED/ENHANCED EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY
---------------------------------------

- List modifications to existing features, where the previous behavior
  wouldn't actually be considered a bug

- Nodes are now treated as PathLike objects.

- Replace use of old conditional expression idioms with the official
  one from PEP 308 introduced in Python 2.5 (2006). The idiom being
  replaced (using and/or) is regarded as error prone.

- MSVS: The default Windows powershell 7 path is added before the default
  Windows powershell 5 path in the limited environment in which the
  MSVC batch files are run.

FIXES
-----

- Fixed SCons.Variables.PackageVariable to correctly test the default
  setting against both enable & disable strings. (Fixes #4702)
- MSVS: Fix significant slowdown initializing MSVC tools when vcpkg has
  been installed on the system.

IMPROVEMENTS
------------

- List improvements that wouldn't be visible to the user in the
  documentation:  performance improvements (describe the circumstances
  under which they would be observed), or major code cleanups

- Virtualenv support module modernized: previously looked first for an
  unofficial approach from before venv support was made part of Python
  in 3.3; now looks for the official approach first. This in an internal
  detail, the API is unchanged.

PACKAGING
---------

- List changes in the way SCons is packaged and/or released

- The generated roff (.1) manpages are now included in the
  scons-doc tarball that is built at part of the release process,
  in addition to the html and txt versions. For distribution
  packaging, the manpages can be extracted from here (downloadable
  from https://scons.org/doc/ using a a version-specific URL,
  e.g. https://scons.org/doc/4.9.1/scons-doc-4.9.1.tar.gz).

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

- List any significant changes to the documentation (not individual
  typo fixes, even if they're mentioned in src/CHANGES.txt to give
  the contributor credit)

- Clarify how pre/post actions on an alias work.

- Improve the description of PackageVariable.

- The "API Docs" build (Sphinx) configuration is improved, and
  SConsDoc and SConsExample are now included - their API is
  interesting to developers working on SCons (needed to write docs),
  even if not part of "The SCons API" itself.

- Missing documentation for the Virtualenv() function is added.
  Note that the User Guide previously described a negative outcome
  as returning None.  It is now explicit that the path is returned if
  running in a virtualenv, and an empty (falsy) string if not.

DEVELOPMENT
-----------

- List visible changes in the way SCons is developed

- runtest.py once again finds "external" tests, such as the tests for
  tools in scons-contrib. An earlier rework had broken this.  Fixes #4699.

- Clean up C and C++ FLAGS tests. Tests which use a real compiler
  are now more clearly distinguished (-live.py suffix and docstring).
- Fix a couple of unit tests to not fail with Python 3.14. These involve
  expectations for bytecode and error message contents; there was no problem
  with SCons itself using 3.14 in its current (just-before-freeze) state.

Thanks to the following contributors listed below for their contributions to this release.
