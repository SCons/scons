==================================================================

A new SCons release, 4.4.1, is now available on the SCons download page:

    https://scons.org/pages/download.html


Here is a summary of the changes since 4.4.0:

NOTE: If you build with Python 3.10.0 and then rebuild with 3.10.1 (or higher), you may
      see unexpected rebuilds. This is due to Python internals changing which changed
      the signature of a Python Action Function.


NEW FUNCTIONALITY
-----------------

- Added ValidateOptions() which will check that all command line options are in either
  those specified by SCons itself, or by AddOption() in SConstruct/SConscript.  It should
  not be called until all AddOption() calls are completed. Resolves Issue #4187
- Added --experimental=tm_v2, which enables Andrew Morrow's NewParallel Job implementation.
  This should scale much better for highly parallel builds.  You can also enable this via SetOption().
- Added VCPkg() builder, integrating the vcpkg cross-platform package management tool for
  3rd-party C/C++ libraries (http://vcpkg.io). A project using SCons can use the VCPkg()
  builder to to download and build any package known to vcpkg. Works on Windows, Linux and MacOS.


DEPRECATED FUNCTIONALITY
------------------------

- List anything that's been deprecated since the last release

CHANGED/ENHANCED EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY
---------------------------------------

- Added -fsanitize support to ParseFlags().  This will propagate to CCFLAGS and LINKFLAGS.
- Calling EnsureSConsVersion() and EnsurePythonVersion() won't initialize
  DefaultEnvironment anymore.
- The console message from the Chmod() action function now displays
  octal modes using the modern Python syntax (0o755 rather than 0755).
- Migrated logging logic for --taskmastertrace to use Python's logging module. Added logging
  to NewParallel Job class (Andrew Morrow's new parallel job implementation)


FIXES
-----

- Added missing newline to generated compilation database (compile_commands.json)
- A list argument as the source to the Copy() action function is now handled.
  Both the implementation and the strfunction which prints the progress
  message were adjusted.
- The Java Scanner processing of JAVACLASSPATH for dependencies (behavior
  that was introduced in SCons 4.4.0) is adjusted to split on the system's
  search path separator instead of on a space. The previous behavior meant
  that a path containing spaces (e.g. r"C:\somepath\My Classes") would
  lead to unexpected errors. If the split-on-space behavior is desired,
  pre-split the value: instead of: env["JAVACLASSPATH"] = "foo bar baz"
  use: env["JAVACLASSPATH"] = env.Split("foo bar baz")
  There is no change in how JAVACLASSPATH gets turned into the -classpath
  argument passed to the JDK tools.
- Ninja: Fix execution environment sanitation for launching ninja. Previously if you set an
  execution environment variable set to a python list it would crash. Now it
  will create a string joining the list with os.pathsep
- Fixed command line argument --diskcheck: previously a value of 'none' was ignored.
  SetOption('diskcheck','none') is unaffected, as it did not have the problem.
- Fixed Issue #4275 - when outputting compilation db and TEMPFILE was in use, the compilation db would have
  command lines using the generated tempfile for long command lines, instead of the full command line for
  the compilation step for the source/target pair.
- A refactor in the caching logic for version 4.4.0 left Java inner classes
  failing with an exception when a CacheDir was enabled. This is now corrected.


IMPROVEMENTS
------------

- Changed the Taskmaster trace logic to use python's logging module.
- Add cache-debug messages for push failures.
- Added error message to handle the case when SCons attempts to retrieve all the targets
  for a specified builder from the CacheDir, fails to do so, and then runs into an error
  when deleting the files which were retrieved. Previously if this happened there were no
  errors or warnings.

PACKAGING
---------

- SCons now has three requirements files: requirements.txt describes
  requirements to run scons; requirements-dev.txt requirements to
  develop it - mainly things needed to run the testsuite;
  requirements_pkg.txt are the requirements to do a full build
  (including docs build) with an intent to create the packages.
- Moved rpm and debian directories under packaging
- Added logic to help packagers enable reproducible builds into packaging/etc/.
  Please read packaging/etc/README.txt if you are interested.
- A zipapp of scons-local is now also built.


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

- Updated the --hash-format manpage entry.
- EnsureSConsVersion, EnsurePythonVersion, Exit, GetLaunchDir and
  SConscriptChdir are now listed as Global functions only.
- Updated the docs for Glob.
- Updated SHELL_ENV_GENERATORS description and added versionadded indicator.
- JAVABOOTCLASSPATH, JAVACLASSPATH and JAVASOURCEPATH better document the
  acceptable syntax for values, and how they will be interpreted,
  including that JAVACLASSPATH will be scanned for dependencies.
  Added note on the possibly surprising feature that SCons always passes
  -sourcepath when calling javac, which affects how the class path is
  used when finding sources.
- Updated the User Guide chapter on installation: modernized the notes
  on Python installs, SCons installs, and having multiple SCons versions
  present on a single system.
- Updated the User Guide chapter on variant directories with more
  explanation, and the introduction of terms like "out of tree" that
  may help in forming a mental model.

DEVELOPMENT
-----------

- Refactored SCons/Taskmaster into a package. Moved SCons/Jobs.py into that package.
  NOTE: If you hook into SCons.Jobs, you'll have to change that to use SCons.Taskmaster.Jobs
- Refactored SCons.Util, which had grown quite large, to be a package,
  not a single-file module. Change should be transparent: the same import
  of SCons.Util and public symbols from it will continue to work, however
  code which reaches directly in to grab private symbols (starting with
  underscore) which moved to a submodule, that code will have to be adjusted,
  as those are not imported to the package level (new SCons.Util.hashes has
  some of these, which are used by existing unit tests).
- Added overrides argument to SCons.Subst.scons_subst(), subst_list(), subst(), and Action's process(),
  strfunction(). This allows passing a dictionary of envvars to override when evaluating subst()'d strings/lists
