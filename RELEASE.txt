==================================================================

A new SCons release, 4.4.1, is now available on the SCons download page:

    https://scons.org/pages/download.html


Here is a summary of the changes since 4.4.0:

NEW FUNCTIONALITY
-----------------

- List new features (presumably why a checkpoint is being released)

DEPRECATED FUNCTIONALITY
------------------------

- List anything that's been deprecated since the last release

CHANGED/ENHANCED EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY
---------------------------------------

- List modifications to existing features, where the previous behavior
  wouldn't actually be considered a bug

- Override environments, created when giving construction environment
  keyword arguments to Builder calls (or manually, through the
  undocumented Override method), were modified not to "leak" on item deletion.
  The item will now not be deleted from the base environment.

- Added support for tracking beamer themes in the LaTeX scanner.

- Add a tag to each CacheDir to let systems ignore backing it up
  (per https://bford.info/cachedir/). Update the way a CacheDir
  is created, since it now has to create two files.

FIXES
-----
- PackageVariable now does what the documentation always said it does
  if the variable is used on the command line with one of the enabling
  string as the value: the variable's default value is produced (previously
  it always produced True in this case).

- Temporary files created by TempFileMunge() are now cleaned up on
  scons exit, instead of at the time they're used.  Fixes #4595.

- AddOption now correctly adds short (single-character) options.
  Previously an added short option would always report as unknown,
  while long option names for the same option worked. Short options
  that take a value require the user to specify the value immediately
  following the option, with no spaces (e.g. -j5 and not -j 5).

- Fix a problem with compilation_db component initialization - the
  entries for assembler files were not being set up correctly.
- On Darwin, PermissionErrors are now handled while trying to access
  /etc/paths.d. This may occur if SCons is invoked in a sandboxed environment
  (such as Nix).
- Added error handling when creating MS VC detection debug log file specified by
  SCONS_MSCOMMON_DEBUG

- Fix nasm test for missing include file, cleanup.

- Skip running a few validation tests if the user is root and the test is
  not designed to work for the root user.

IMPROVEMENTS
------------

- List improvements that wouldn't be visible to the user in the
  documentation:  performance improvements (describe the circumstances
  under which they would be observed), or major code cleanups

- For consistency with the optparse "add_option" method, AddOption accepts
  an SConsOption object as a single argument (this failed previously).
  Calling AddOption with the full set of arguments (option names and
  attributes) to set up the option is still the recommended approach.

- Add clang and clang++ to the default tool search orders for POSIX
  and Windows platforms. These will be searched for after gcc and g++,
  respectively. Does not affect explicitly requested tool lists.  Note:
  on Windows, SCons currently only has builtin support for clang, not
  for clang-cl, the version of the frontend that uses cl.exe-compatible
  command line switches.

PACKAGING
---------

- List changes in the way SCons is packaged and/or released

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

- List any significant changes to the documentation (not individual
  typo fixes, even if they're mentioned in src/CHANGES.txt to give
  the contributor credit)

- Some manpage cleanup for the gettext and pdf/ps builders.

- Some clarifications in the User Guide "Environments" chapter.

- Clarify documentation of Repository() in manpage and user guide.

DEVELOPMENT
-----------

- List visible changes in the way SCons is developed
