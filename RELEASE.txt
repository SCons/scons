If you are reading this in the git repository, the contents
refer to *unreleased* changes since the last SCons release.
Past official release announcements appear at:

==================================================================

A new SCons release, 4.6.1, is now available on the SCons download page:

    https://scons.org/pages/download.html


Here is a summary of the changes since 4.6.0:

NEW FUNCTIONALITY
-----------------

- List new features (presumably why a checkpoint is being released)

DEPRECATED FUNCTIONALITY
------------------------

- List anything that's been deprecated since the last release

CHANGED/ENHANCED EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY
---------------------------------------

- List modifications to existing features, where the previous behavior
  wouldn't actually be considered a bug

FIXES
-----

- Fix of the --debug=sconscript option to return exist statements when using return
  statement with stop flag enabled
- When expanding $FORTRANMODDIR and $DI_FILE_DIR (the latter new in this
  release), incorrect results could be obtained when Repository() has been
  called, and/or when a variant directory is used with duplicate=False.
  In some cases, this could cause the compiler to abort with an error.
  The expansion is now handled so the path relative to the build directory
  is passed to the compiler as the directory to write into, and the
  additional directories are enabled as search directories.

IMPROVEMENTS
------------

- Use of NotImplemented instead of NotImplementedError for special methods
  of _ListVariable class

PACKAGING
---------

- Remove unecessary dependencies on pypi packages from setup.cfg

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

- List any significant changes to the documentation (not individual
  typo fixes, even if they're mentioned in src/CHANGES.txt to give
  the contributor credit)

DEVELOPMENT
-----------

- List visible changes in the way SCons is developed

Thanks to the following contributors listed below for their contributions to this release.
