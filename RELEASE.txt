Here is a summary of the changes since 4.9.1:


NEW FUNCTIONALITY
-----------------

- List new features (presumably why a checkpoint is being released)

DEPRECATED FUNCTIONALITY
------------------------

- List anything that's been deprecated since the last release

CHANGED/ENHANCED EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY
---------------------------------------

- List modifications to existing features, where the previous behavior
  wouldn't actually be considered a bug

- Nodes are now treated as PathLike objects.

FIXES
-----

- Fixed SCons.Variables.PackageVariable to correctly test the default
  setting against both enable & disable strings. (Fixes #4702)

IMPROVEMENTS
------------

- List improvements that wouldn't be visible to the user in the
  documentation:  performance improvements (describe the circumstances
  under which they would be observed), or major code cleanups

PACKAGING
---------

- List changes in the way SCons is packaged and/or released

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

- List any significant changes to the documentation (not individual
  typo fixes, even if they're mentioned in src/CHANGES.txt to give
  the contributor credit)

DEVELOPMENT
-----------

- runtest.py once again finds "external" tests, such as the tests for
  tools in scons-contrib. An earlier rework had broken this.  Fixes #4699.

Thanks to the following contributors listed below for their contributions to this release.
