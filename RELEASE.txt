    https://scons.org/pages/download.html


Here is a summary of the changes since PREVIOUS_RELEASE:

NEW FUNCTIONALITY
-----------------

- Add support for Visual Studio 2026.

CHANGED/ENHANCED EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY
---------------------------------------

- Switch test framework from using profile to cProfile. profile
  generates deprecation warnings starting with Python 3.15.

FIXES
-----

- Enable membership tests on instances of Literal (non-substituting string).

- In the SequenceTypes tuple used for dynamic type checks, include
  the dict contents views, exclude the dictionary view itself as it
  is not an iterable sequence type.

IMPROVEMENTS
------------

- Internal: where the find method on a string was used to determine
  if a substring is present, use the more readable "in" and "not in".

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

- Improve documentation of builder methods and builder objects.

- Make links clickable in the SetOption and GetOption manpage entries.
