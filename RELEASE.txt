  not be called until all AddOption() calls are completed. Resolves Issue #4187
- Added VCPkg() builder, integrating the vcpkg cross-platform package management tool for
  3rd-party C/C++ libraries (http://vcpkg.io). A project using SCons can use the VCPkg()
  builder to to download and build any package known to vcpkg. Works on Windows, Linux and MacOS.
