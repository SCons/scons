A new SCons release, 4.1.0, is now available
on the SCons download page:

      https://scons.org/pages/download.html


Here is a summary of the changes since 4.1.0:

NEW FUNCTIONALITY
-----------------

- List new features (presumably why a checkpoint is being released)

DEPRECATED FUNCTIONALITY
------------------------

- List anything that's been deprecated since the last release

CHANGED/ENHANCED EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY
---------------------------------------

- List modifications to existing features, where the previous behavior
  wouldn't actually be considered a bug

FIXES
-----

    - Fix reproducible builds. Restore logic respecting SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH when set.
    - Small fix to ensure CLVar default value is an empty list.
      See MongoDB bug report: https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-59656
      Code contributed by MongoDB.
    - Change Split() so it raises a TypeError when passed no arguments
      or `None`. This reinforces the intended purpose of the function
      and makes it easier to catch errors.
      Code contributed by MongoDB.

  documentation:  performance improvements (describe the circumstances
  under which they would be observed), or major code cleanups

PACKAGING

DOCUMENTATION
