    https://scons.org/pages/download.html


Here is a summary of the changes since 4.5.2:

NEW FUNCTIONALITY
-----------------

- List new features (presumably why a checkpoint is being released)

DEPRECATED FUNCTIONALITY
------------------------

- List anything that's been deprecated since the last release

CHANGED/ENHANCED EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY
---------------------------------------

- List modifications to existing features, where the previous behavior
  wouldn't actually be considered a bug

FIXES
-----

- C scanner's dictifyCPPDEFINES routine did not understand the possible
  combinations of CPPDEFINES - not aware of a "name=value" string either
  embedded in a sequence, or by itself.  The conditional C scanner thus
  did not always properly apply the defines. The regular C scanner does
  not use these, so was not affected.  [fixes #4193]

IMPROVEMENTS
------------

- List improvements that wouldn't be visible to the user in the
  documentation:  performance improvements (describe the circumstances
  under which they would be observed), or major code cleanups

PACKAGING
---------

- List changes in the way SCons is packaged and/or released

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

- List any significant changes to the documentation (not individual
  typo fixes, even if they're mentioned in src/CHANGES.txt to give
  the contributor credit)

DEVELOPMENT
-----------

- List visible changes in the way SCons is developed

Thanks to the following contributors listed below for their contributions to this release.
