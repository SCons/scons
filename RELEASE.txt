A new SCons release, 4.3.1, is now available
on the SCons download page:

      https://scons.org/pages/download.html


Here is a summary of the changes since 4.3.1:

NOTE: If you build with Python 3.10.0 and then rebuild with 3.10.1 (or higher), you may
      see unexpected rebuilds. This is due to Python internals changing which changed 
      the signature of a Python Action Function.


NEW FUNCTIONALITY
-----------------

- List new features (presumably why a checkpoint is being released)

DEPRECATED FUNCTIONALITY
------------------------

- List anything that's been deprecated since the last release

CHANGED/ENHANCED EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY
---------------------------------------

- On Windows, %AllUsersProfile%\scons\site_scons is now the default "system"
  location for a site_scons. %AllUsersProfile%\Application Data\scons\site_scons
  will continue to work. There does not seem to be any convention to use
  an "Application Data" subdirectory here.
- Action._subproc() can now be used as a python context manager to ensure that the
  POpen object is properly closed.
- SCons help (-H) no longer prints the "ignored for compatibility" options,
  which are still listed in the manpage.
- The change to "content" and "content-timestamp" Decider names is reflected
  in the User Guide as well, since the hash function may be other than md5
  (tidying up from earlier change)


FIXES
-----

- Fix a number of Python ResourceWarnings which are issued when running SCons and/or it's tests
  with python 3.9 (or higher)
- Fixed crash in C scanner's dictify_CPPDEFINES() function which happens if
  AppendUnique is called on CPPPATH. (Issue #4108).


IMPROVEMENTS
------------

- Verify that a user specified msvc script (via MSVC_USE_SCRIPT) exists and raise an
  exception immediately when the user specified msvc script does not exist.
- Add cache-debug messages for push failures.
- Command-line help is now sensitive to the size of the terminal window: the
  width of the help text will scale for terminals other than 80 chars wide.

PACKAGING
---------

- Added project_url for mailing lists and Discord
- Updated setup.cfg to remove Python 3.5 and add Python 3.10

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

- List any significant changes to the documentation (not individual
  typo fixes, even if they're mentioned in src/CHANGES.txt to give
  the contributor credit)

DEVELOPMENT
-----------

- List visible changes in the way SCons is developed
