          http://www.scons.org/download.php

    Here is a summary of the changes since 2.4.0:

  NEW FUNCTIONALITY
    - InstallVersionedLib now available in the DefaultEnvironment context.
    - Added new configure check, CheckProg, to check for existence of a program.
    - Add support `Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7' 
      Compiler can be obtained at: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266

  DEPRECATED FUNCTIONALITY

  CHANGED/ENHANCED EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY

    - Reimplemented versioning for shared libraries, with the following effects
    - Fixed tigris issues #3001, #3006.
    - Fixed several other issues not reported to tigris, including:
      issues with versioned libraries in subdirectories with tricky names,
      issues with versioned libraries and variant directories,
      issue with soname not being injected to library when using D linkers,
    - Switched to direct symlinks instead of daisy-chained ones -- soname and
      development symlinks point directly to the versioned shared library now),
      for rationale see:
      https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-sharedlibs.html
      https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines#Devel_Packages
      https://bitbucket.org/scons/scons/pull-requests/247/new-versioned-libraries-gnulink-cyglink/diff#comment-10063929
    - New construction variables to allow override default behavior: SONAME,
      SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS, _SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS, SHLIBNOVERSIONSYMLINKS,
      LDMODULEVERSION, LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS, _LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS,
      LDMODULENOVERSIONSYMLINKS.
    - Changed logic used to configure the versioning machinery from
      platform-centric to linker-oriented.
    - The SHLIBVERSION/LDMODULEVERSION variables are no longer validated by
      SCons (more freedom to users).
    - InstallVersionedLib() doesn't use SHLIBVERSION anymore.
    - Enchanced docs for the library versioning stuff.
    - New tests for versioned libraries.
    - Library versioning is currently implemented for the following linker
      tools: 'cyglink', 'gnulink', 'sunlink'.

  FIXES

    - Fix for issue #2840 - Fix for two environments specifying same target with different
      actions not throwing hard error. Instead SCons was incorrectly issuing a warning
      and continuing.
    - Fix to swig tool - pick-up 'swig', 'swig3.0' and 'swig2.0' (in order).
    - Fix to swig tool - respect env['SWIG'] provided by user.
    - Fix for Bug # 2791 - Setup.py fails unnecessarily under Jython.
    - Fixed license of SVG titlepage files in the context of Debian
      packaging, such that they allow for commercial use too (#2985).
    - Fixed tigris issue #3011: Glob() excludes didn't work when used with VariantDir(duplicate=0)
    - Fix bug 2831 and allow Help() text to be appended to AddOption() help.
