<cvar name="ESCAPE">

A function that will be called to escape shell special characters in
command lines. The function should take one argument: the command line
string to escape; and should return the escaped command line.

<cvar name="LIBPREFIX">
<summary>
The prefix used for (static) library file names.
A default value is set for each platform
(posix, win32, os2, etc.),
but the value is overridden by individual tools
(ar, mslib, sgiar, sunar, tlib, etc.)
to reflect the names of the libraries they create.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="LIBPREFIXES">
<summary>
A list of all legal prefixes for library file names.
When searching for library dependencies,
SCons will look for files with these prefixes,
the base library name,
and suffixes in the &cv-LIBSUFFIXES; list.

<cvar name="PLATFORM">
<summary>
The name of the platform used to create the Environment.  If no platform is
specified when the Environment is created,
&scons;
autodetects the platform.

<example>
env = Environment(tools = [])
if env['PLATFORM'] == 'cygwin':
    Tool('mingw')(env)
else:
    Tool('msvc')(env)
</example>

<cvar name="HOST_OS">
    <summary>
        The name of the host operating system used to create the Environment.
        If a platform is specified when creating the Environment, then
        that Platform's logic will handle setting this value.
        This value is immutable, and should not be changed by the user after
        the Environment is initialized.
        Currently only set for Win32.
    </summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="HOST_ARCH">
    <summary>
        The name of the host hardware architecture used to create the Environment.
        If a platform is specified when creating the Environment, then
        that Platform's logic will handle setting this value.
        This value is immutable, and should not be changed by the user after
        the Environment is initialized.
        Currently only set for Win32.
    </summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="TARGET_OS">
    <summary>
        The name of the target operating system for the compiled objects
        created by this Environment.
        This defaults to the value of HOST_OS, and the user can override it.
        Currently only set for Win32.
    </summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="TARGET_ARCH">
    <summary>
        The name of the target hardware architecture for the compiled objects
        created by this Environment.
        This defaults to the value of HOST_ARCH, and the user can override it.
        Currently only set for Win32.
