<cvar name="SWIG">
<summary>
The scripting language wrapper and interface generator.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="SWIGCFILESUFFIX">
<summary>
The suffix that will be used for intermediate C
source files generated by
the scripting language wrapper and interface generator.
The default value is
<filename>_wrap</filename>&cv-link-CFILESUFFIX;.
By default, this value is used whenever the
<option>-c++</option>
option is
<emphasis>not</emphasis>
specified as part of the
&cv-link-SWIGFLAGS;
construction variable.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="SWIGDIRECTORSUFFIX">
<summary>
The suffix that will be used for intermediate C++ header
files generated by the scripting language wrapper and interface generator.
These are only generated for C++ code when the SWIG 'directors' feature is
turned on.
The default value is
<filename>_wrap.h</filename>.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="SWIGCOM">
<summary>
The command line used to call
the scripting language wrapper and interface generator.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="SWIGCOMSTR">
<summary>
The string displayed when calling
the scripting language wrapper and interface generator.
If this is not set, then &cv-link-SWIGCOM; (the command line) is displayed.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="SWIGCXXFILESUFFIX">
<summary>
The suffix that will be used for intermediate C++
source files generated by
the scripting language wrapper and interface generator.
The default value is
<filename>_wrap</filename>&cv-link-CFILESUFFIX;.
By default, this value is used whenever the
<filename>-c++</filename>
option is specified as part of the
&cv-link-SWIGFLAGS;
construction variable.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="SWIGFLAGS">
<summary>
General options passed to
the scripting language wrapper and interface generator.
This is where you should set
<option>-python</option>,
<option>-perl5</option>,
<option>-tcl</option>,
or whatever other options you want to specify to SWIG.
If you set the
<option>-c++</option>
option in this variable,
&scons;
will, by default,
generate a C++ intermediate source file
with the extension that is specified as the
&cv-link-CXXFILESUFFIX;
variable.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="_SWIGINCFLAGS">
<summary>
An automatically-generated construction variable
containing the SWIG command-line options
for specifying directories to be searched for included files.
The value of &cv-_SWIGINCFLAGS; is created
by appending &cv-SWIGINCPREFIX; and &cv-SWIGINCSUFFIX;
to the beginning and end
of each directory in &cv-SWIGPATH;.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="SWIGINCPREFIX">
<summary>
The prefix used to specify an include directory on the SWIG command line.
This will be appended to the beginning of each directory
in the &cv-SWIGPATH; construction variable
when the &cv-_SWIGINCFLAGS; variable is automatically generated.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="SWIGINCSUFFIX">
<summary>
The suffix used to specify an include directory on the SWIG command line.
This will be appended to the end of each directory
in the &cv-SWIGPATH; construction variable
when the &cv-_SWIGINCFLAGS; variable is automatically generated.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="SWIGOUTDIR">
<summary>
Specifies the output directory in which
the scripting language wrapper and interface generator
should place generated language-specific files.
This will be used by SCons to identify
the files that will be generated by the &swig; call,
and translated into the
<literal>swig -outdir</literal> option on the command line.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="SWIGPATH">
<summary>
The list of directories that the scripting language wrapper
and interface generate will search for included files.
The SWIG implicit dependency scanner will search these
directories for include files.
The default is to use the same path
specified as &cv-CPPPATH;.

Don't explicitly put include directory
arguments in SWIGFLAGS;
the result will be non-portable
and the directories will not be searched by the dependency scanner.
Note: directory names in SWIGPATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript
directory when they are used in a command.
To force
&scons;
to look-up a directory relative to the root of the source tree use #:

<example>
env = Environment(SWIGPATH='#/include')
</example>

The directory look-up can also be forced using the
&Dir;()
function:

<example>
include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(SWIGPATH=include)
</example>

The directory list will be added to command lines
through the automatically-generated
&cv-_SWIGINCFLAGS;
construction variable,
which is constructed by
appending the values of the
&cv-SWIGINCPREFIX; and &cv-SWIGINCSUFFIX;
construction variables
to the beginning and end
of each directory in &cv-SWIGPATH;.
Any command lines you define that need
the SWIGPATH directory list should
include &cv-_SWIGINCFLAGS;:

<example>
env = Environment(SWIGCOM="my_swig -o $TARGET $_SWIGINCFLAGS $SORUCES")
</example>
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="SWIGVERSION">
<summary>
The version number of the SWIG tool.
</summary>
</cvar>
