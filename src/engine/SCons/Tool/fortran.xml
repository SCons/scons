<cvar name="FORTRAN">
<summary>
The default Fortran compiler
for all versions of Fortran.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="FORTRANCOM">
<summary>
The command line used to compile a Fortran source file to an object file.
By default, any options specified
in the &cv-FORTRANFLAGS;, &cv-CPPFLAGS;, &cv-_CPPDEFFLAGS;, 
&cv-_FORTRANMODFLAG;, and &cv-_FORTRANINCFLAGS; construction variables
are included on this command line.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="FORTRANCOMSTR">
<summary>
The string displayed when a Fortran source file
is compiled to an object file.
If this is not set, then &cv-FORTRANCOM;
(the command line) is displayed.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="FORTRANFLAGS">
<summary>
General user-specified options that are passed to the Fortran compiler.
Note that this variable does
<emphasis>not</emphasis>
contain
<option>-I</option>
(or similar) include or module search path options
that scons generates automatically from &cv-FORTRANPATH;.
See
&cv-_FORTRANINCFLAGS; and &cv-_FORTRANMODFLAG;,
below,
for the variables that expand those options.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="_FORTRANINCFLAGS">
<summary>
An automatically-generated construction variable
containing the Fortran compiler command-line options
for specifying directories to be searched for include 
files and module files.
The value of &cv-_FORTRANINCFLAGS; is created
by prepending/appending &cv-INCPREFIX; and &cv-INCSUFFIX;
to the beginning and end
of each directory in &cv-FORTRANPATH;.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="FORTRANMODDIR">
<summary>
Directory location where the Fortran compiler should place
any module files it generates.  This variable is empty, by default. Some 
Fortran compilers will internally append this directory in the search path 
for module files, as well
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="FORTRANMODDIRPREFIX">
<summary>
The prefix used to specify a module directory on the Fortran compiler command
line.
This will be appended to the beginning of the directory
in the &cv-FORTRANMODDIR; construction variables
when the &cv-_FORTRANMODFLAG; variables is automatically generated.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="FORTRANMODDIRSUFFIX">
<summary>
The suffix used to specify a module directory on the Fortran compiler command
line.
This will be appended to the beginning of the directory
in the &cv-FORTRANMODDIR; construction variables
when the &cv-_FORTRANMODFLAG; variables is automatically generated.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="_FORTRANMODFLAG">
<summary>
An automatically-generated construction variable
containing the Fortran compiler command-line option
for specifying the directory location where the Fortran
compiler should place any module files that happen to get 
generated during compilation.
The value of &cv-_FORTRANMODFLAG; is created
by prepending/appending &cv-FORTRANMODDIRPREFIX; and &cv-FORTRANMODDIRSUFFIX;
to the beginning and end of the directory in &cv-FORTRANMODDIR;.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="FORTRANMODPREFIX">
<summary>
The module file prefix used by the Fortran compiler.  SCons assumes that
the Fortran compiler follows the quasi-standard naming convention for
module files of
<filename>module_name.mod</filename>.
As a result, this variable is left empty, by default.  For situations in
which the compiler does not necessarily follow the normal convention,
the user may use this variable.  Its value will be appended to every
module file name as scons attempts to resolve dependencies.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="FORTRANMODSUFFIX">
<summary>
The module file suffix used by the Fortran compiler.  SCons assumes that
the Fortran compiler follows the quasi-standard naming convention for
module files of
<filename>module_name.mod</filename>.
As a result, this variable is set to ".mod", by default.  For situations
in which the compiler does not necessarily follow the normal convention,
the user may use this variable.  Its value will be appended to every
module file name as scons attempts to resolve dependencies.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="FORTRANPATH">
<summary>
The list of directories that the Fortran compiler will search for
include files and (for some compilers) module files. The Fortran implicit
dependency scanner will search these directories for include files (but
not module files since they are autogenerated and, as such, may not
actually exist at the time the scan takes place). Don't explicitly put
include directory arguments in FORTRANFLAGS because the result will be
non-portable and the directories will not be searched by the dependency
scanner. Note: directory names in FORTRANPATH will be looked-up relative
to the SConscript directory when they are used in a command. To force
&scons;
to look-up a directory relative to the root of the source tree use #:

<example>
env = Environment(FORTRANPATH='#/include')
</example>

The directory look-up can also be forced using the 
&Dir;()
function:

<example>
include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(FORTRANPATH=include)
</example>

The directory list will be added to command lines
through the automatically-generated
&cv-_FORTRANINCFLAGS;
construction variable,
which is constructed by
appending the values of the
&cv-INCPREFIX; and &cv-INCSUFFIX;
construction variables
to the beginning and end
of each directory in &cv-FORTRANPATH;.
Any command lines you define that need
the FORTRANPATH directory list should
include &cv-_FORTRANINCFLAGS;:

<example>
env = Environment(FORTRANCOM="my_compiler $_FORTRANINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")
</example>
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="FORTRANPPCOM">
<summary>
The command line used to compile a Fortran source file to an object file
after first running the file through the C preprocessor. 
By default, any options specified in the &cv-FORTRANFLAGS;, &cv-CPPFLAGS;,
_CPPDEFFLAGS, &cv-_FORTRANMODFLAG;, and &cv-_FORTRANINCFLAGS;
construction variables are included on this command line.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="FORTRANSUFFIXES">
<summary>
The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned
for Fortran implicit dependencies
(INCLUDE lines and USE statements).
The default list is:

<example>
[".f", ".F", ".for", ".FOR", ".ftn", ".FTN", ".fpp", ".FPP",
".f77", ".F77", ".f90", ".F90", ".f95", ".F95"]
</example>
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="SHFORTRAN">
<summary>
The default Fortran compiler used for generating shared-library objects.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="SHFORTRANCOM">
<summary>
The command line used to compile a Fortran source file
to a shared-library object file.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="SHFORTRANCOMSTR">
<summary>
The string displayed when a Fortran source file
is compiled to a shared-library object file.
If this is not set, then &cv-SHFORTRANCOM;
(the command line) is displayed.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="SHFORTRANFLAGS">
<summary>
Options that are passed to the Fortran compiler
to generate shared-library objects.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="SHFORTRANPPCOM">
<summary>
The command line used to compile a Fortran source file to a
shared-library object file
after first running the file through the C preprocessor.
Any options specified
in the &cv-SHFORTRANFLAGS; and &cv-CPPFLAGS; construction variables
are included on this command line.
