<cvar name="CC">
<summary>
The C compiler.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="CCCOM">
<summary>
The command line used to compile a C source file to a (static) object
file.  Any options specified in the &cv-link-CFLAGS;, &cv-link-CCFLAGS; and
&cv-link-CPPFLAGS; construction variables are included on this command
line.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="CCCOMSTR">
<summary>
The string displayed when a C source file
is compiled to a (static) object file.
If this is not set, then &cv-link-CCCOM; (the command line) is displayed.

<example>
env = Environment(CCCOMSTR = "Compiling static object $TARGET")
</example>
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="CCFLAGS">
<summary>
General options that are passed to the C and C++ compilers.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="CFLAGS">
<summary>
General options that are passed to the C compiler (C only; not C++).
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="CPPFLAGS">
<summary>
User-specified C preprocessor options.
These will be included in any command that uses the C preprocessor,
including not just compilation of C and C++ source files
via the &cv-link-CCCOM;,
&cv-link-SHCCCOM;,
&cv-link-CXXCOM; and
&cv-link-SHCXXCOM; command lines,
but also the &cv-link-FORTRANPPCOM;,
&cv-link-SHFORTRANPPCOM;,
&cv-link-F77PPCOM; and
&cv-link-SHF77PPCOM; command lines
used to compile a Fortran source file,
and the &cv-link-ASPPCOM; command line
used to assemble an assembly language source file,
after first running each file through the C preprocessor.
Note that this variable does
<emphasis>not</emphasis>
contain
<option>-I</option>
(or similar) include search path options
that scons generates automatically from &cv-link-CPPPATH;.
See &cv-link-_CPPINCFLAGS;, below,
for the variable that expands to those options.

<cvar name="CPPSUFFIXES">
<summary>
The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned

</cvar>

<cvar name="SHCCCOM">
<summary>
The command line used to compile a C source file
to a shared-library object file.
Any options specified in the &cv-link-SHCFLAGS;,
&cv-link-SHCCFLAGS; and
&cv-link-CPPFLAGS; construction variables
are included on this command line.

<cvar name="SHCCCOMSTR">
<summary>
The string displayed when a C source file
is compiled to a shared object file.
If this is not set, then &cv-link-SHCCCOM; (the command line) is displayed.
