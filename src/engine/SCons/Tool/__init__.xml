<builder name="CFile">

<para>
Builds a C source file given a lex (<filename>.l</filename>)
or yacc (<filename>.y</filename>) input file.
The suffix specified by the &cv-link-CFILESUFFIX; construction variable
(<filename>.c</filename> by default)
is automatically added to the target
if it is not already present.
Example:
</para>

<example_commands>
# builds foo.c
env.CFile(target = 'foo.c', source = 'foo.l')
# builds bar.c
env.CFile(target = 'bar', source = 'bar.y')

<builder name="CXXFile">
<summary>
<para>
Builds a C++ source file given a lex (<filename>.ll</filename>)
or yacc (<filename>.yy</filename>)
input file.
The suffix specified by the &cv-link-CXXFILESUFFIX; construction variable
(<filename>.cc</filename> by default)
is automatically added to the target

<builder name="Program">
<summary>
<para>
Builds an executable given one or more object files
or C, C++, D, or Fortran source files.
If any C, C++, D or Fortran source files are specified,
then they will be automatically
compiled to object files using the
&b-Object;
builder method;
see that builder method's description for
a list of legal source file suffixes
and how they are interpreted.
The target executable file prefix
(specified by the &cv-link-PROGPREFIX; construction variable; nothing by default)
and suffix
(specified by the &cv-link-PROGSUFFIX; construction variable;
by default, <filename>.exe</filename> on Windows systems,
nothing on POSIX systems)
are automatically added to the target if not already present.
Example:
</para>

<example_commands>
env.Program(target = 'foo', source = ['foo.o', 'bar.c', 'baz.f'])
</example_commands>
</summary>
</builder>

<builder name="SharedLibrary">
<summary>
<para>
Builds a shared library
(<filename>.so</filename> on a POSIX system,
<filename>.dll</filename> on Windows)
given one or more object files
or C, C++, D or Fortran source files.
If any source files are given,
then they will be automatically
compiled to object files.
The static library prefix and suffix (if any)
are automatically added to the target.
The target library file prefix
(specified by the &cv-link-SHLIBPREFIX; construction variable;
by default, <filename>lib</filename> on POSIX systems,
nothing on Windows systems)
and suffix
(specified by the &cv-link-SHLIBSUFFIX; construction variable;
by default, <filename>.dll</filename> on Windows systems,
<filename>.so</filename> on POSIX systems)
are automatically added to the target if not already present.
Example:
</para>

<example_commands>
env.SharedLibrary(target = 'bar', source = ['bar.c', 'foo.o'])
</example_commands>

<para>
On Windows systems, the
&b-SharedLibrary;
builder method will always build an import
(<filename>.lib</filename>) library
in addition to the shared (<filename>.dll</filename>) library,
adding a <filename>.lib</filename> library with the same basename
if there is not already a <filename>.lib</filename> file explicitly
listed in the targets.
</para>

<para>
On Cygwin systems, the
&b-SharedLibrary;
builder method will always build an import
(<filename>.dll.a</filename>) library
in addition to the shared (<filename>.dll</filename>) library,
adding a <filename>.dll.a</filename> library with the same basename
if there is not already a <filename>.dll.a</filename> file explicitly
listed in the targets.
</para>

<para>
Any object files listed in the
<literal>source</literal>
must have been built for a shared library
(that is, using the
&b-SharedObject;
builder method).
&scons;
will raise an error if there is any mismatch.
</para>

<para>
On some platforms, there is a distinction between a shared library
(loaded automatically by the system to resolve external references)
and a loadable module (explicitly loaded by user action).
For maximum portability, use the &b-LoadableModule; builder for the latter.
</para>

<para>
When the &cv-link-SHLIBVERSION; construction variable is defined a versioned
shared library is created. This modifies the &cv-link-SHLINKFLAGS; as required,
adds the version number to the library name, and creates the symlinks that
are needed. &cv-link-SHLIBVERSION; needs to be of the form X.Y.Z, where X
and Y are numbers, and Z is a number but can also contain letters to designate
alpha, beta, or release candidate patch levels.
</para>

<example_commands>
env.SharedLibrary(target = 'bar', source = ['bar.c', 'foo.o'], SHLIBVERSION='1.5.2')
</example_commands>


<para>
This builder may create multiple links to the library. On a POSIX system,
for the shared library libbar.so.2.3.1, the links created would be
libbar.so and libbar.so.2; on a Darwin (OSX) system
the library would be libbar.2.3.1.dylib and the link would be
libbar.dylib.
</para>

<para>
On Windows systems, specifying
<literal>register=1</literal>
will cause the <filename>.dll</filename> to be
registered after it is built using REGSVR32.
The command that is run
("regsvr32" by default) is determined by &cv-link-REGSVR; construction
variable, and the flags passed are determined by &cv-link-REGSVRFLAGS;.  By
default, &cv-link-REGSVRFLAGS; includes the <option>/s</option> option,
to prevent dialogs from popping
up and requiring user attention when it is run.  If you change
&cv-link-REGSVRFLAGS;, be sure to include the <option>/s</option> option.
For example,
</para>

<example_commands>
env.SharedLibrary(target = 'bar',
                  source = ['bar.cxx', 'foo.obj'],
                  register=1)
</example_commands>

<para>
will register <filename>bar.dll</filename> as a COM object
when it is done linking it.
</para>
</summary>
</builder>

<builder name="SharedObject">
<summary>
<para>
Builds an object file for
inclusion in a shared library.
Source files must have one of the same set of extensions
specified above for the
&b-StaticObject;
builder method.
On some platforms building a shared object requires additional
compiler option
(e.g. <option>-fPIC</option> for gcc)
in addition to those needed to build a
normal (static) object, but on some platforms there is no difference between a
shared object and a normal (static) one. When there is a difference, SCons
will only allow shared objects to be linked into a shared library, and will
use a different suffix for shared objects. On platforms where there is no
difference, SCons will allow both normal (static)
and shared objects to be linked into a
shared library, and will use the same suffix for shared and normal
(static) objects.
The target object file prefix
(specified by the &cv-link-SHOBJPREFIX; construction variable;
by default, the same as &cv-link-OBJPREFIX;)
and suffix
(specified by the &cv-link-SHOBJSUFFIX; construction variable)
are automatically added to the target if not already present.
Examples:
</para>

<example_commands>
env.SharedObject(target = 'ddd', source = 'ddd.c')
env.SharedObject(target = 'eee.o', source = 'eee.cpp')
env.SharedObject(target = 'fff.obj', source = 'fff.for')
</example_commands>

<para>
Note that the source files will be scanned
according to the suffix mappings in the
<literal>SourceFileScanner</literal>
object.
See the section "Scanner Objects,"
below, for more information.
</para>
</summary>
</builder>

<builder name="StaticLibrary">
<summary>
<para>
Builds a static library given one or more object files
or C, C++, D or Fortran source files.
If any source files are given,
then they will be automatically
compiled to object files.
The static library prefix and suffix (if any)
are automatically added to the target.
The target library file prefix
(specified by the &cv-link-LIBPREFIX; construction variable;
by default, <filename>lib</filename> on POSIX systems,
nothing on Windows systems)
and suffix
(specified by the &cv-link-LIBSUFFIX; construction variable;
by default, <filename>.lib</filename> on Windows systems,
<filename>.a</filename> on POSIX systems)
are automatically added to the target if not already present.
Example:
</para>

<example_commands>
env.StaticLibrary(target = 'bar', source = ['bar.c', 'foo.o'])

<cvar name="CCVERSION">

SCons also treats files with the suffixes
<filename>.cpp</filename>,
