        # processed, and any tests that completed before the failure
        # would have resulted in new tests being queued for execution.

        # Apply the following operational heuristics of Job.py:
        #  0) An initial jobset of tasks will be queued before any
        #     good/bad results are obtained (from "execute" of task in
        #     thread).
        #  1) A goodnode will complete immediately on its thread and
        #     allow another node to be queued for execution.
        #  2) A badnode will complete immediately and suppress any
        #     subsequent execution queuing, but all currently queued
        #     tasks will still be processed.
        #  3) A slowbadnode will fail later.  It will block slots in
        #     the job queue.  Nodes that complete immediately will
        #     allow other nodes to be queued in their place, and this
        #     will continue until either (#2) above or until all job
        #     slots are filled with slowbadnode entries.

        # One approach to validating this test would be to try to
        # determine exactly how many nodes executed, how many didn't,
        # and the results of each, and then to assert failure on any
        # mismatch (including the total number of built nodes).
        # However, while this is possible to do for a single-processor
        # system, it is nearly impossible to predict correctly for a
        # multi-processor system and still test the characteristics of
        # delayed execution nodes.  Stated another way, multithreading
        # is inherently non-deterministic unless you can completely
        # characterize the entire system, and since that's not
        # possible here, we shouldn't try.

        # Therefore, this test will simply scan the set of nodes to
        # see if the node was executed or not and if it was executed
