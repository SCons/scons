   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

SCons API Documentation
=======================

.. Attention::
   This is the **internal** API Documentation for SCons.
   The documentation is automatically generated for each release
   from the source code using the
   `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ tool.
   Missing information is due to shortcomings in the docstrings in the code,
   which are by no means complete (contributions welcomed!).

   The target audience is developers working on SCons itself:
   what is "Public API" is not clearly deliniated here.
   The interfaces available for use in SCons configuration scripts,
   which have a consistency guarantee, are those documented in the 
   `SCons Reference Manual
   <https://scons.org/doc/production/HTML/scons-man.html>`_.
