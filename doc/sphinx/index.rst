SCons Project API Documentation
===============================

This is the internal API Documentation for SCons.
The Documentation is generated using the Sphinx tool.
The target audience is developers working on SCons itself,
so it does not clearly delineate what is "Public API" -
interfaces for use in your SCons configuration scripts
which have a consistency guarantee, and what is internal,
so always keep the SCons manual page around for helping
with such determinations.
