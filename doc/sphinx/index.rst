   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

SCons API Documentation
=======================

.. Attention::
   This is the **internal** API Documentation for SCons.
   The documentation is automatically generated for each release
   from the source code using the
   `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ documentation generator.
   Missing information is due to shortcomings in the docstrings in the code,
   which admittedly could use a lot more work (contributions welcomed!).

   The target audience is both developers working on SCons itself,
   and those writing external Tools, Builders, etc. and other
   related functionality, who need to reach beyond the Public API.
   Note that what is Public API is not clearly deliniated in the API Docs.
   The interfaces available for use in SCons configuration scripts
   ("SConscript files"), which have a consistency guarantee,
   are those documented in the `SCons Reference Manual
   <https://scons.org/doc/production/HTML/scons-man.html>`_.
