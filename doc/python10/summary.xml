    This paper has introduced &SCons;, a next-generation build tool
    with a modular, embeddable architecture and a direct Python
    interface. &SCons; has a global view of the dependencies in a source
    tree, uses MD5 signatures to decide if derived files are out-of-date,
    and automatically scans files for dependencies, all of which make &SCons;
    builds exceptionally reliable. The &SCons; development methodology has
    been described, notable for its emphasis on automated regression
    testing to ensure a robust and reliable tool from day one. Several
    future directions for &SCons; have also been discussed.
