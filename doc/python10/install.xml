<para>

  Initial installation of a new utility provides the first, lasting
  impression of how well the software is likely to perform. From the
  start, &SCons; has made clean installation a priority.

</para>

<section>
  <title>Version Control</title>

  <para>

    Distributing an application like &SCons; that depends
    on a package normally found in a library poses a
    problem. If the &scons; script and the &SCons; Build Engine
    are installed separately, it could be easy
    to introduce a version mismatch between the Build Engine
    installed in
    <filename>/usr/lib/python*/site-packages</filename>
    and the &scons; script installed in
    <filename>/usr/bin</filename>.
    Such a mismatch
    could possible mean exceptions that prevent builds, or even worse,
    silently unreliable builds.

  </para>

  <para>

    To reduce the possibility of a version mismatch,
    the &scons; script looks first for its
    imported modules in <filename>/usr/lib/scons-{version}/</filename>,
    then in <filename>/usr/lib/scons/</filename>,
    and then in the normal &PYTHONPATH; locations,
    including <filename>/usr/lib/python*/site-packages</filename>).
    Searching in a version-specific library directory first
    makes it convenient to install and use multiple
    side-by-side versions of &SCons;,
    which is sometimes important
    when verifying that a new version does not introduce any
    errors into the local build process.
    Searching next in an &SCons;-specific library directory
    makes it convenient for other software to find
    the &SCons; Build Engine without having to worry about
    installing separate copies for
    multiple versions of Python.

  <para>

    Like other software written in Python, &SCons; benefits greatly from
    the tremendous effort put into the <literal>distutils</literal> by
    Greg Ward and others. These take care of 90% of the work by making
    it almost trivial to generate the appropriate RPM files, Debian
    packages, and Windows installer.

  </para>

</section>

<section>
  <title>Default Builder Objects</title>

  <para>

    As part of the installation process, &SCons; runs a set of scripts
    that look for popular compilers and other tools and set up
    appropriate default &Builder; objects for the tools found. These
    &Builder; objects are then used to initialize the default &consenv;
    values.

  </para>

</section>

<section>
  <title>Default Scanner Objects</title>

  <para>

    Additionally, &SCons; comes with a stock set of &Scanner; objects
    for the various file types that it supports out of the box. Any
    unusal &Scanner; objects required for a specific tool will be
    detected at installation time and associated with the appropriate
    &Builder; object for the tool.
