=head2 The C<Command> method

The C<Command> method is a catchall method which can be used to arrange for
any build action to be executed to update the target. For this command, a
target file and list of inputs is provided. In addition, a build action
is specified as the last argument.  The build action is typically a
command line or lines, but may also contain Perl code to be executed;
see the section above on build actions for details.

The C<Command> method is called as follows:

  Command $env <target>, <inputs>, <build action>;

The target is made dependent upon the list of input files specified, and the
inputs must be built successfully or Cons will not attempt to build the
target.

To specify a command with multiple targets, you can specify a reference to a
list of targets. In Perl, a list reference can be created by enclosing a
list in square brackets. Hence the following command:

  Command $env ['foo.h', 'foo.c'], 'foo.template', q(
	gen %1
  );

could be used in a case where the command C<gen> creates two files, both
F<foo.h> and F<foo.c>.
