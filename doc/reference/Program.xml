=head2 The C<Program> method

The C<Program> method arranges to link the specified program with the
specified object files. It is invoked in the following manner:

  Program $env <program name>, <source or object files>;

The program name will have the value of the C<SUFEXE> construction
variable appended (by default, C<.exe> on Win32 systems, nothing on Unix
systems) if the suffix is not already present.

Source files may be specified in place of objects files-,-the C<Objects>
method will be invoked to arrange the conversion of all the files into
object files, and hence all the observations about the C<Objects> method,
above, apply to this method also.

The actual linking of the program will be handled by an external command
which results from expanding the C<LINKCOM> construction variable, with
C<%E<lt>> set to the object files to be linked (in the order presented),
and C<%E<gt>> set to the target. (See the section above on construction
variable expansion for details.)  The user may set additional variables
in the construction environment, including C<LINK>, to define which
program to use for linking, C<LIBPATH>, a colon-separated list of
library search paths, for use with library specifications of the form
I<-llib>, and C<LIBS>, specifying the list of libraries to link against
(in either I<-llib> form or just as pathnames. Relative pathnames in
both C<LIBPATH> and C<LIBS> are interpreted relative to the directory
in which the associated construction environment is created (absolute
and top-relative names may also be used). Cons automatically sets up
dependencies on any libraries mentioned in C<LIBS>: those libraries will
be built before the command is linked.
