=head2 The C<Objects> method

The C<Objects> method arranges to create the object files that correspond to
the specified source files. It is invoked as shown below:

  @files = Objects $env <source or object files>;

Under Unix, source files ending in F<.s> and F<.c> are currently
supported, and will be compiled into a name of the same file ending
in F<.o>. By default, all files are created by invoking the external
command which results from expanding the C<CCCOM> construction variable,
with C<%E<lt>> and C<%E<gt>> set to the source and object files,
respectively. (See the section above on construction variable expansion
for details).  The variable C<CPPPATH> is also used when scanning source
files for dependencies. This is a colon separated list of pathnames, and
is also used to create the construction variable C<_IFLAGS,> which will
contain the appropriate list of -C<I> options for the compilation. Any
relative pathnames in C<CPPPATH> is interpreted relative to the
directory in which the associated construction environment was created
(absolute and top-relative names may also be used). This variable is
used by C<CCCOM>. The behavior of this command can be modified by
changing any of the variables which are interpolated into C<CCCOM>, such
as C<CC>, C<CFLAGS>, and, indirectly, C<CPPPATH>. It's also possible
to replace the value of C<CCCOM>, itself. As a convenience, this file
returns the list of object filenames.
