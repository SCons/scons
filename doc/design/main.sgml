      &SCons; offers a robust and feature-rich design for an SC-build
      tool.  With a Build Engine based on the proven design of
      the &Cons; utility, it offers increased simplification of the
      user interface for unsophisticated users with the addition
      of the "do-the-right-thing" <function>env.Make</function>
      method, increased flexibility for sophisticated users with the
      addition of &Builder; and &Scanner; objects, a mechanism to
      allow tool-masters (and users) to share working construction
      environments, and embeddability to provide reliable dependency
      management in a variety of environments and interfaces.
