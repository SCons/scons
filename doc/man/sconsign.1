.SH NAME
sconsign \- print SCons .sconsign file information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sconsign
[
.IR options ...
]
.IR file
[ ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION

The 
.B sconsign
command
displays the contents of one or more
.B .sconsign
files specified by the user.

By default,
.B sconsign
dumps the entire contents of the
specified file(s).
Each entry is printed in the following format:

    file: timestamp bsig csig
            implicit_dependency_1
            implicit_dependency_2

If the entry has no timestamp, bsig, or csig, a dash
.B None
is printed.
If the entry has no implicit dependencies,
the lines are simply omitted.

By default,
.B sconsign
assumes that any
.I file
arguments that end with a
.B .dbm
suffix contains
signature entries for
more than one directory
(that is,
was specified by the
.B SConsignFile ()
function).
Any
.I file
argument that does not end in
.B .dbm
is assumed to be a traditional
.B .sconsign
file containing the signature entries
for a single directory.
An explicit format
may be specified using the
.B -f
or
.B --file=
options.

.SH OPTIONS

Various options control what information is printed
and the format:

.TP
-b, --bsig

for all entries or the specified entries.

.TP
-c, --csig
Prints the content signature (csig) information
for all entries or the specified entries.

.TP
-d DIRECTORY, --dir=DIRECTORY
When the signatures are being
read from a
.B .dbm
file, or the
.B -f dbm
or
.B --format=dbm
options are used,
prints information about
only the signatures
for entries in the specified
.IR DIRECTORY .

.TP
-e ENTRY, --entry=ENTRY
Prints information about only the specified
.IR ENTRY .
Multiple -e options may be used,
in which case information about each
.I ENTRY
is printed in the order in which the
options are specified on the command line.

.TP
-f FORMAT, --format=FORMAT
The file(s) to be printed
are in the specified
.IR FORMAT .
Legal values are
.B dbm
(the DBM format used
when the
.BR SConsignFile ()
function is used)
or
.B sconsign
(the default format
used for an individual
.B .sconsign
file in each directory).

.TP
-h, --help
Prints a help message and exits.

.TP
-i, --implicit
Prints the list of cached implicit dependencies
for all entries or the the specified entries.

Prints the timestamp information
for all entries or the specified entries.

.TP
