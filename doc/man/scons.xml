<title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<para>
&scons;
orchestrates the construction of software
(and other tangible products such as documentation files)
by determining which
component pieces must be built or rebuilt and invoking the necessary
commands to build them.</para>

<para>You instruct
&scons; by writing a configuration file
which specifies the files to be built (<firstterm>targets</firstterm>),
and, if necessary, the rules to build those files.  Premade
rules exist for building many common software components
such as executable programs, object files, libraries,
so that for many software projects,
only the target and input files need be specified.</para>

<para>
When invoked, &scons;
searches for a file named
&SConstruct;
(it also checks alternate spellings
&Sconstruct;, &sconstruct;, &SConstruct.py; &Sconstruct.py;
and &sconstruct.py;
in that order) in the current directory and reads its
configuration from that file.
An alternate file name may be
specified via the
<option>-f</option>
option.
The &SConstruct;
file can specify subsidiary
configuration files by calling the
&SConscriptFunc; function.
By convention,
these subsidiary files are named
&SConscript;,
although any name may be used.
As a result of this naming convention,
the term <firstterm>SConscript files</firstterm>
is often used to refer
generically to the complete set of
configuration files for a project
(including the &SConstruct; file),
regardless of the actual file names or number of such files.</para>

<para>Before reading the SConscript files,
&scons;
looks for a directory named
<filename>site_scons</filename>
in various system directories and in the directory containing the
&SConstruct; file and prepends the ones it
finds to the Python module search path (<varname>sys.path</varname>),
thus allowing modules in such directories to be imported in
the normal Python way in SConscript files.
For each found site directory,
if it contains a file <filename>site_init.py</filename>
it is evaluated, and if it contains a directory
<filename>site_tools</filename> the path to it
is prepended to the default toolpath.
See the
<option>--site-dir</option>
and
<option>--no-site-dir</option>
options for details on default paths and
controlling the site directories.
</para>

<para>
&scons; configuration files are written in the
<firstterm>Python</firstterm> programming language,
although it is normally not necessary to be a Python
programmer to use &scons; effectively.
Standard Python scripting capabilities
such as flow control, data manipulation, and imported Python libraries
are available to use to handle complicated build situations.
</para>

<para>
&scons;
reads and executes all of the SConscript files
<emphasis>before</emphasis>
it begins building any targets.
To make this clear,
&scons;
prints the following messages about what it is doing:</para>

<screen>
$ <userinput>scons foo.out</userinput>
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets  ...
cp foo.in foo.out
scons: done building targets.
$
</screen>

<para>The status messages
(lines beginning with the <literal>scons:</literal> tag)
may be suppressed using the
<option>-Q</option>
option.</para>

<para>&scons;
does not automatically propagate
the external environment used to execute
&scons;
to the commands used to build target files.
This is so that builds will be guaranteed
repeatable regardless of the environment
variables set at the time
&scons;
is invoked.
This also means that if the compiler or other commands
that you want to use to build your target files
are not in standard system locations,
&scons;
will not find them unless
you explicitly include the locations into the value of
<varname>PATH</varname> in the <varname>ENV</varname>
variable in the internal &consenv;.
Whenever you create a &consenv;,
you can propagate the value of <envar>PATH</envar>
from your external environment as follows:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
import os
env = Environment(ENV={'PATH': os.environ['PATH']})
</programlisting>

<para>Similarly, if the commands use specific
external environment variables that &scons;
does not recognize, they can be propagated into
the internal environment:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
import os
env = Environment(ENV={'PATH': os.environ['PATH'],
                       'ANDROID_HOME': os.environ['ANDROID_HOME'],
                       'ANDROID_NDK_HOME': os.environ['ANDROID_NDK_HOME']})
</programlisting>

<para>Or you may explicitly propagate the invoking user's
complete external environment:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
import os
env = Environment(ENV=os.environ)
</programlisting>

<para>This comes at the expense of making your build
dependent on the user's environment being set correctly,
but it may be more convenient for many configurations.
It should not cause problems if done in a build setup which tightly
controls how the environment is set up before invoking
&scons;, as in many continuous
integration setups.
</para>

<para>&scons;
can scan known input files automatically for dependency
information (for example, <literal>#include</literal>
preprocessor directives in C or C++ files)
and will rebuild dependent files appropriately
whenever any "included" input file changes.
&scons;
supports the
ability to define new scanners for unknown input file types.</para>

<para>&scons;
is normally executed in a top-level directory containing an
&SConstruct; file.
When &scons; is invoked,
the command line (including the contents
of the &SCONSFLAGS; environment variable,
if set) is processed.
Command-line options (see <xref linkend="options"/>) are consumed.
Any variable argument assignments are collected, and
remaining arguments are taken as the targets to build.</para>

<para>Values of variables to be passed to the SConscript files
may be specified on the command line:</para>

<screen>
<userinput>scons debug=1</userinput>
</screen>

<para>These variables are available
through the &ARGUMENTS; dictionary,
and can be used in the SConscript files to modify
the build in any way:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
if ARGUMENTS.get('debug', 0):
    env = Environment(CCFLAGS='-g')
else:
    env = Environment()
</programlisting>

<para>The command-line variable arguments are also available
in the &ARGLIST; list,
indexed by their order on the command line.
This allows you to process them in order rather than by name,
if necessary. Each &ARGLIST; entry is a tuple containing
(<replaceable>argname</replaceable>, <replaceable>argvalue</replaceable>).
</para>

<para>Targets on the command line may be files, directories,
or phony targets defined using the &Alias; function.
The command line targets are made available in the
&COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS; list.
</para>

<para>If no targets are specified on the command line,
&scons;
will build the default targets. The default targets
are those specified in the SConscript files via calls
to the &Default; function; if none, the default targets are
those target files in or below the current directory.
Targets specified via the &Default; function are available
in the &DEFAULT_TARGETS; list.
</para>

<para>To ignore the default targets specified
through calls to &Default; and instead build all
target files in or below the current directory
specify the current directory (<literal>.</literal>)
as a command-line target:</para>

<screen>
<userinput>scons .</userinput>
</screen>

<para>To build all target files,
including any files outside of the current directory,
supply a command-line target
of the root directory (on POSIX systems):</para>

<screen>
<userinput>scons /</userinput>
</screen>

<para>or the path name(s) of the volume(s) in which all the targets
should be built (on Windows systems):</para>

<screen>
<userinput>scons C:\ D:\</userinput>
</screen>

<para>A subset of a hierarchical tree may be built by
remaining at the top-level directory (where the
&SConstruct;
file lives) and specifying the subdirectory as the target to
build:</para>

<screen>
<userinput>scons src/subdir</userinput>
</screen>

<para>or by changing directory and invoking scons with the
<option>-u</option>
option, which traverses up the directory
hierarchy until it finds the
&SConstruct;
file, and then builds
targets relatively to the current subdirectory (see
also the related <option>-D</option> and <option>-U</option> options):</para>

<screen>
<userinput>cd src/subdir</userinput>
<userinput>scons -u .</userinput>
</screen>

<para>In all cases, more files may be built than are
requested, as &scons; needs to make
sure any dependent files are built.</para>

<para>Specifying "cleanup" targets in SConscript files is not usually necessary.
The
<option>-c</option>
flag removes all files
necessary to build the specified target:</para>

<screen>
<userinput>scons -c .</userinput>
</screen>

<para>to remove all target files in or under the current directory, or:</para>

<screen>
<userinput>scons -c build export</userinput>
</screen>

<para>to remove target files under <filename>build</filename>
and <filename>export</filename>.</para>

<para>
Additional files or directories to remove can be specified using the
&Clean; function in the SConscript files.
Conversely, targets that would normally be removed by the
<option>-c</option>
invocation can be retained by calling the
&NoClean; function with those targets.</para>

<para>&scons;
supports building multiple targets in parallel via a
<option>-j</option>
option that takes, as its argument, the number
of simultaneous tasks that may be spawned:</para>

<screen>
<userinput>scons -j 4</userinput>
</screen>

<para>builds four targets in parallel, for example.</para>

<para>&scons;
can maintain a cache of target (derived) files that can
be shared between multiple builds.  When caching is enabled in a
SConscript file, any target files built by
&scons;
will be copied
to the cache.  If an up-to-date target file is found in the cache, it
will be retrieved from the cache instead of being rebuilt locally.
Caching behavior may be disabled and controlled in other ways by the
<option>--cache-force</option>,
<option>--cache-disable</option>,
<option>--cache-readonly</option>,
and
<option>--cache-show</option>
command-line options.  The
<option>--random</option>
option is useful to prevent multiple builds
from trying to update the cache simultaneously.</para>

<!--  The following paragraph reflects the default tool search orders -->
<!--  currently in SCons/Tool/__init__.py.  If any of those search orders -->
<!--  change, this documentation should change, too. -->

<para>By default,
&scons;
searches for known programming tools
on various systems and initializes itself based on what is found.
On Windows systems which identify as <emphasis>win32</emphasis>,
&scons;
searches in order for the
Microsoft Visual C++ tools,
the MinGW tool chain,
the Intel compiler tools,
and the PharLap ETS compiler.
On Windows system which identify as <emphasis>cygwin</emphasis>
(that is, if &scons; is invoked from a cygwin shell),
the order changes to prefer the GCC toolchain over the MSVC tools.
On OS/2 systems,
&scons;
searches in order for the
OS/2 compiler,
the GCC tool chain,
and the Microsoft Visual C++ tools,
On SGI IRIX, IBM AIX, Hewlett Packard HP-UX, and Oracle Solaris systems,
&scons;
searches for the native compiler tools
(MIPSpro, Visual Age, aCC, and Forte tools respectively)
and the GCC tool chain.
On all other platforms,
including POSIX (Linux and UNIX) platforms,
&scons;
searches in order
for the GCC tool chain,
and the Intel compiler tools.
These default values may be overridden
by appropriate setting of &consvars;.</para>

<para>&scons;
requires Python 3.5 or higher.
There should be no other dependencies or requirements to run &scons;,
although the <package>pywin32</package> Python package is
strongly recommended if running on Windows systems.

(When

is executed without the
<option>-j</option>
option,
the elapsed wall-clock time will typically
be slightly longer than the total time spent
executing all the build commands,
due to the SCons processing that takes place
in between executing each command.
When
&scons;
is executed
<emphasis>with</emphasis>
the
<option>-j</option>
option,
and your build configuration allows good parallelization,
the elapsed wall-clock time should
be significantly smaller than the
total time spent executing all the build commands,
since multiple build commands and
intervening SCons processing
should take place in parallel.)

Multiple checks can be specified separated by commas.
for example,

would still check for SCCS and RCS sources,
but disable the check for on-disk matches of files and directories.
Disabling some or all of these checks
can provide a performance boost for large configurations,
or when the configuration will check for files and/or directories
across networked or shared file systems,
at the slight increased risk of an incorrect build
or of not handling errors gracefully
(if include files really should be
found in SCCS or RCS, for example,
or if a file really does exist
where the SCons configuration expects a directory).</para>

<envar>CPPPATH</envar>, <envar>LIBPATH</envar>)
that would ordinarily
cause different versions of same-named files to be used.</para>

<para>&scons;
will miss changes in the implicit dependencies
in cases where a new implicit
dependency is added earlier in the implicit dependency search path
(e.g.

The default value is 2 days, which means a file must have a
modification time of at least two days ago in order to have its
cached content signature used.
A negative value means to never cache the content
signature and to ignore the cached value if there already is one. A value
of 0 means to always use the cached signature,

block-by-block. A huge block-size leads to high memory consumption while a very

<title>Construction Environments</title>

<para>A <firstterm>&ConsEnv;</firstterm> is the basic means by which SConscript
files communicate build information to
&scons;.
A new &consenv; is created using the
&f-link-Environment;
function:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env = Environment()
</programlisting>

<para>&Consenv; attributes called
<firstterm>&ConsVars;</firstterm> may be set
either by specifying them as keyword arguments when the object is created
or by assigning them a value after the object is created:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env = Environment(FOO='foo')
env['BAR'] = 'bar'
</programlisting>

<!--TODO: want to say this, but then have to provide a way for user to tell...
<para>Certain settings that affect tool detection work
only on initialization, so check that setting a value
after creation is appropriate.</para>
-->

<para>
An existing &consenv; can be duplicated by calling the &f-link-env-Clone;
method. Without arguments, it will be a copy with the same
settings. Otherwise, &f-env-Clone; takes the same arguments as &f-Environment;,
and uses the arguments to create a modified copy.
</para>

<para>
&SCons; also provides a special &consenv; called the
<firstterm>&DefEnv;</firstterm>.
The &defenv; is used only for global functions, that is,
construction activities called without the context of a regular &consenv;.
See &f-link-DefaultEnvironment; for more information.
</para>

<para>As a convenience,
&consvars; may also be set or modified by the
<parameter>parse_flags</parameter>
keyword argument, which applies the
&f-link-env-MergeFlags;
method (described below) to the argument value
after all other processing is completed.
This is useful either if the exact content of the flags is unknown
(for example, read from a control file)
or if the flags need to be distributed to a number of &consvars;.</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env = Environment(parse_flags='-Iinclude -DEBUG -lm')
</programlisting>

<para>This example adds 'include' to
the <envar>CPPPATH</envar> &consvar;
'EBUG' to
<envar>CPPDEFINES</envar>,
and 'm' to
<envar>LIBS</envar>.
&f-link-env-ParseFlags; describes how these arguments
are distributed to &consvars;.
</para>


<para>By default, a new &consenv; is
initialized with a set of builder methods
and &consvars; that are appropriate
for the current platform.
An optional <parameter>platform</parameter> keyword argument may be
used to specify that the &consenv; should
be initialized for a different platform:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env = Environment(platform='cygwin')
env = Environment(platform='os2')
env = Environment(platform='posix')
env = Environment(platform='win32')
</programlisting>

<para>Specifying a platform initializes the appropriate
&consvars; in the environment
to use and generate file names with prefixes
and suffixes appropriate for that platform.</para>

<para>Note that the
<emphasis role="bold">win32</emphasis>
platform adds the
<envar>SystemDrive</envar>
and
<envar>SystemRoot</envar>
variables from the user's external environment
to the &consenv;'s
<envar>ENV</envar>
dictionary.
This is so that any executed commands
that use sockets to connect with other systems
(such as fetching source files from
external CVS repository specifications like
<literal>:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/scons</literal>)
will work on Windows systems.</para>

<para>The <parameter>platform</parameter> argument may be a function or callable object,
in which case the &Environment; method
will call it to update
the new &consenv;:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
def my_platform(env):
    env['VAR'] = 'xyzzy'

env = Environment(platform=my_platform)
</programlisting>

</refsect2>

<refsect2 id='tools'>
<title>Tools</title>

<para>
&SCons; has a large number of predefined tools which
are used to help initialize the &consenv;,
and additional tools can be added.
An &scons; <firstterm>tool specification</firstterm>
is only responsible for setup.
For example, if the SConscript file declares
the need to construct an object file from
a C-language source file by calling the
&b-link-Object; builder, then a tool representing
an available C compiler needs to have run first,
to set up the builder and all the &consvars;
it needs, in that &consenv;. Normally this
happens invisibly: &scons; has per-platform
lists of default tools, and it runs through those tools,
calling the ones which are actually applicable
(skipping those where necessary programs are not
installed on the build system, etc.).
</para>

<para>
A specific set of tools
with which to initialize the environment when
creating it
may be specified using the optional keyword argument
<parameter>tools</parameter>.
This is useful to override the defaults,
to specify non-default built-in tools, and
to supply added tools:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env = Environment(tools=['msvc', 'lex'])
</programlisting>

<para>
Tools can also be called by using the &f-link-Tool;
method (see below).
</para>

<para>
The <parameter>tools</parameter> argument overrides
the default tool list, it does not add to it, so be
sure to include all the tools you need.
For example if you are  building a c/c++ program
you must specify a tool for at least a compiler and a linker,
as in <literal>tools=['clang', 'link']</literal>.
The tool name <literal>'default'</literal> can
be used to retain the default list.
</para>

<para>If no <parameter>tools</parameter> list is specified,
or the list includes <literal>'default'</literal>,
then &scons; will detect usable tools,
using the value of <varname>PATH</varname>
in the <varname>ENV</varname> &consvar; (<emphasis>not</emphasis>
the external <envar>PATH</envar> from <varname>os.environ</varname>)
for looking up any backing programs, and the platform name in effect
to determine the default tools for that platform.
Changing the <varname>PATH</varname>
variable after the &consenv; is constructed will not cause the tools to
be redetected.</para>

<para>To help locate added tools, specify the
<parameter>toolpath</parameter> keyword argument:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env = Environment(tools=['default', 'foo'], toolpath=['tools'])
</programlisting>

<para>
This looks for a tool specification in <filename>tools/foo.py</filename>
as well as using the ordinary default tools for the platform.
</para>

<para>
Tools in the toolpath are used in preference to
any of the built-in ones.  For example, adding
a tool <filename>gcc.py</filename> to the toolpath
directory would override the built-in gcc tool.
The toolpath is
stored in the environment and will be
picked up by subsequent calls to the
&f-Clone; and &f-Tool; methods:
</para>

<programlisting language="python">
base = Environment(toolpath=['custom_path'])
derived = base.Clone(tools=['custom_tool'])
derived.CustomBuilder()
</programlisting>

<para>
A tool specification must include two functions:
</para>

<variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
    <term><function>generate</function>(<parameter>env, **kwargs</parameter>)</term>
    <listitem>
<para>Modifies the environment referenced by <parameter>env</parameter>
to set up variables so that the facilities represented by
the tool can be executed.
It may use any keyword arguments
that the user supplies in <parameter>kwargs</parameter>
to vary its initialization.</para>
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
    <term><function>exists</function>(<parameter>env</parameter>)</term>
    <listitem>
<para>Return <constant>True</constant> if the tool can
be called. Usually this means looking up one or more
known programs using the <envar>PATH</envar> from the
supplied <parameter>env</parameter>, but the tool can
make the "exists" decision in any way it chooses.
</para>
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>The elements of the <parameter>tools</parameter> list may also
be functions or callable objects,
in which case the &Environment; method
will call those objects
to update the new &consenv; (see &f-link-Tool; for more details):</para>

<programlisting language="python">
def my_tool(env):
    env['XYZZY'] = 'xyzzy'

env = Environment(tools=[my_tool])
</programlisting>

<para>The individual elements of the <parameter>tools</parameter> list
may also themselves be lists or tuples of the form
(<varname>toolname</varname>, <varname>kw_dict</varname>).
SCons searches for the
<parameter>toolname</parameter>
specification file as described above, and
passes
<parameter>kw_dict</parameter>,
which must be a dictionary, as keyword arguments to the tool's
<function>generate</function>
function.
The
<function>generate</function>
function can use the arguments to modify the tool's behavior
by setting up the environment in different ways
or otherwise changing its initialization.</para>

<programlisting language="python">
# in tools/my_tool.py:
def generate(env, **kwargs):
  # Sets MY_TOOL to the value of keyword 'arg1' '1' if not supplied
  env['MY_TOOL'] = kwargs.get('arg1', '1')

def exists(env):
  return True

# in SConstruct:
env = Environment(tools=['default', ('my_tool', {'arg1': 'abc'})],
                  toolpath=['tools'])
</programlisting>

<para>The tool definition (<function>my_tool</function> in the example)

<envar>PLATFORM</envar> variable from
the &consenv; it is passed to customize the tool for different platforms.</para>

<para>Tools can be "nested" - that is, they
can be located within a subdirectory in the toolpath.
A nested tool name uses a dot to represent a directory separator</para>

<programlisting language="python">
# namespaced builder

<title>Builder Methods</title>

<para>You tell &scons; what to build
by calling <firstterm>Builders</firstterm>, functions which know to take a
particular action to produce a particular result type
when given source files of a particular type. &scons;
defines a number of builders, and you can also write your own.
Builders are attached to a &consenv; as methods,
and the available builder methods are listed as
key-value pairs in the
<envar>BUILDERS</envar> attribute of the &consenv;.
The available builders can be displayed like this
for debugging purposes:
</para>

<programlisting language="python">
print("Builders:", list(env['BUILDERS']))
</programlisting>

<para>
Builder methods always take two arguments:
<replaceable>target</replaceable>
(a target or a list of targets to be built)
and
<replaceable>source</replaceable>
(a source or list of sources to be used as input
when building),
although in some circumstances,
the target argument can actually be omitted (see below).
Builder methods also take a variety of
keyword arguments, described below.
</para>

<para>Because long lists of file names
can lead to a lot of quoting,
&scons;
supplies a &f-link-Split;
global function
and a same-named environment method
that splits a single string
into a list, using
strings of white-space characters as the delimiter.
(similar to the Python string <function>split</function>
method, but succeeds even if the input isn't a string.)</para>

<para>
The target and source arguments to a builder method
can be specified either as positional arguments,
in which case the target comes first, or as
keyword arguments, using <parameter>target=</parameter>
and <parameter>source=</parameter>.
The following are equivalent examples of calling the
&Program; builder method:
</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env.Program('bar', ['bar.c', 'foo.c'])
env.Program('bar', Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program('bar', env.Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program(source=['bar.c', 'foo.c'], target='bar')
env.Program(target='bar', source=Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program(target='bar', source=env.Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program('bar', source='bar.c foo.c'.split())
</programlisting>

<para>
Python follows the POSIX pathname convention for path
strings: if a string begins with the operating system pathname separator
(on Windows both the slash and backslash separator work,
and any leading drive specifier is ignored for
the determination) it is considered an absolute path,
otherwise it is a relative path.
If the path string contains no separator characters,
it is searched for as a file in the current directory. If it
contains separator characters, the search follows down
from the starting point, which is the top of the directory tree for
an absolute path and the current directory for a relative path.
</para>
<para>
&scons; recognizes a third way to specify
path strings: if the string begins with
the <emphasis role="bold">#</emphasis> character it is
<firstterm>top-relative</firstterm> - it works like a relative path but the
search follows down from the directory containing the top-level
&SConstruct; rather than
from the current directory. The <emphasis role="bold">#</emphasis> is allowed
to be followed by a pathname separator, which is ignored if
found in that position.
Top-relative paths only work in places where &scons; will
interpret the path (see some examples below).  To be
used in other contexts the string will need to be converted
to a relative or absolute path first.
</para>

<para>
Target and source pathnames can be absolute, relative, or
top-relative. Relative pathnames are searched considering the
directory of the SConscript
file currently being processed as the "current directory".
</para>

# The comments describing the targets that will be built
# assume these calls are in a SConscript file in the
# a subdirectory named "subdir".

# Builds the program "subdir/foo" from "subdir/foo.c":
env.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

# Builds the program "/tmp/bar" from "subdir/bar.c":
env.Program('/tmp/bar', 'bar.c')

# An initial '#' or '#/' are equivalent; the following
# calls build the programs "foo" and "bar" (in the
# top-level SConstruct directory) from "subdir/foo.c" and
# "subdir/bar.c", respectively:
env.Program('#foo', 'foo.c')
env.Program('#/bar', 'bar.c')

# Builds the program "other/foo" (relative to the top-level
# SConstruct directory) from "subdir/foo.c":
env.Program('#other/foo', 'foo.c')

# This will not work, only SCons interfaces understand '#',
# os.path.exists is pure Python:
if os.path.exists('#inc/foo.h'):
    env.Append(CPPPATH='#inc')
</programlisting>

<para>When the target shares the same base name
as the source and only the suffix varies,
and if the builder method has a suffix defined for the target file type,
then the target argument may be omitted completely,
and
&scons;
will deduce the target file name from
the source file name.
The following examples all build the
executable program
<emphasis role="bold">bar</emphasis>
(on POSIX systems)
or
<emphasis role="bold">bar.exe</emphasis>
(on Windows systems)
from the <filename>bar.c</filename> source file:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env.Program(target='bar', source='bar.c')
env.Program('bar', source='bar.c')
env.Program(source='bar.c')
env.Program('bar.c')
</programlisting>

<para>As a convenience, a
<parameter>srcdir</parameter>
keyword argument may be specified
when calling a Builder.
When specified,
all source file strings that are not absolute paths
or top-relative paths
will be interpreted relative to the specified
<parameter>srcdir</parameter>.
The following example will build the
<filename>build/prog</filename>
(or
<filename>build/prog.exe</filename>
on Windows)
program from the files
<filename>src/f1.c</filename>
and
<filename>src/f2.c</filename>:
</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env.Program('build/prog', ['f1.c', 'f2.c'], srcdir='src')
</programlisting>

<para>It is possible to <firstterm>override</firstterm> (replace or add)
&consvars; when calling a
builder method by passing them as keyword arguments.
These overrides
will only be in effect when building that target, and will not
affect other parts of the build. For example, if you want to specify
some libraries needed by just one program:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env.Program('hello', 'hello.c', LIBS=['gl', 'glut'])
</programlisting>

<para>or generate a shared library with a non-standard suffix:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env.SharedLibrary('word', 'word.cpp',
                  SHLIBSUFFIX='.ocx',
                  LIBSUFFIXES=['.ocx'])
</programlisting>

<para>Note that both the &cv-link-SHLIBSUFFIX;
and &cv-link-LIBSUFFIXES;
variables must be set if you want &scons; to search automatically
for dependencies on the non-standard library names;
see the descriptions below of these variables for more information.</para>

<para>It is also possible to use the
<parameter>parse_flags</parameter>
keyword argument in an override,
to merge command-line style arguments
into the appropriate &consvars;
(see &f-link-env-MergeFlags;).
</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env = Program('hello', 'hello.c', parse_flags='-Iinclude -DEBUG -lm')
</programlisting>

<para>This example adds 'include' to
<envar>CPPPATH</envar>,
'EBUG' to
<envar>CPPDEFINES</envar>,
and 'm' to
<envar>LIBS</envar>.</para>

<para>Although the builder methods defined by
&scons;
are, in fact,
methods of a &consenv; object,
they may also be called without an explicit environment:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
Program('hello', 'hello.c')
SharedLibrary('word', 'word.cpp')
</programlisting>

<para>In this case,
the methods are called internally using a default construction
environment that consists of the tools and values that
&scons;
has determined are appropriate for the local system.</para>

<para>Builder methods that can be called without an explicit
environment may be called from custom Python modules that you
import into an SConscript file by adding the following
to the Python module:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
from SCons.Script import *
</programlisting>

<para>All builder methods return a list-like object
containing Nodes that will be built.
A <firstterm>Node</firstterm>
is an internal SCons object
which represents
build targets or sources.</para>

<para>The returned Node-list object
can be passed to other builder methods as source(s)
or passed to any &SCons; function or method
where a filename would normally be accepted.
For example, if it were necessary
to add a specific preprocessor define
when compiling one specific object file:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
bar_obj_list = env.StaticObject('bar.c', CPPDEFINES='-DBAR')
env.Program(source=['foo.c', bar_obj_list, 'main.c'])
</programlisting>

<para>Using a Node in this way
makes for a more portable build
by avoiding having to specify
a platform-specific object suffix
when calling the &Program; builder method.</para>

<para>Builder calls will automatically "flatten"
lists passed as source and target, so they are free to
contain elements which are themselves lists, such as
<varname>bar_obj_list</varname>
returned by the &StaticObject; call above.
If you need to manipulate a list of lists returned by builders
directly in Python code,
you can either build a new list by hand:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
foo = Object('foo.c')
bar = Object('bar.c')
objects = ['begin.o'] + foo + ['middle.o'] + bar + ['end.o']
for obj in objects:
    print(str(obj))
</programlisting>

<para>Or you can use the &f-link-Flatten;
function supplied by &scons;
to create a list containing just the Nodes,
which may be more convenient:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
foo = Object('foo.c')
bar = Object('bar.c')
objects = Flatten(['begin.o', foo, 'middle.o', bar, 'end.o'])
for obj in objects:
    print(str(obj))
</programlisting>

<para>&SCons; builder calls return
a list-like object, not an actual Python list,
so it is not appropriate to use the Python add
operator (<literal>+</literal> or <literal>+=</literal>)
to append builder results to a Python list.
Because the list and the object are different types,
Python will not update the original list in place,
but will instead create a new Node-list object
containing the concatenation of the list
elements and the builder results.
This will cause problems for any other Python variables
in your SCons configuration
that still hold on to a reference to the original list.
Instead, use the Python list
<function>extend</function>
method to make sure the list is updated in-place.
Example:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
object_files = []

# Do NOT use += here:
#    object_files += Object('bar.c')
#
# It will not update the object_files list in place.
#
# Instead, use the list extend method:
object_files.extend(Object('bar.c'))
</programlisting>

<para>The path name for a Node's file may be used
by passing the Node to Python's builtin
<function>str</function>
function:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
bar_obj_list = env.StaticObject('bar.c', CPPDEFINES='-DBAR')
print("The path to bar_obj is:", str(bar_obj_list[0]))
</programlisting>

<para>Note again that because the Builder call returns a list,
we have to access the first element in the list
(<literal>(bar_obj_list[0])</literal>)
to get at the Node that actually represents
the object file.</para>

<para>Builder calls support a
<parameter>chdir</parameter>
keyword argument that
specifies that the Builder's action(s)
should be executed
after changing directory.
If the
<parameter>chdir</parameter>
argument is
a string or a directory Node,
scons will change to the specified directory.
If the
<parameter>chdir</parameter>
is not a string or Node
and is non-zero,
then scons will change to the
target file's directory.</para>

<programlisting language="python">
# scons will change to the "sub" subdirectory
# before executing the "cp" command.
env.Command('sub/dir/foo.out', 'sub/dir/foo.in',
            "cp dir/foo.in dir/foo.out",
            chdir='sub')

# Because chdir is not a string, scons will change to the
# target's directory ("sub/dir") before executing the
# "cp" command.
env.Command('sub/dir/foo.out', 'sub/dir/foo.in',
            "cp foo.in foo.out",
            chdir=1)
</programlisting>

<para>Note that &SCons; will
<emphasis>not</emphasis>
automatically modify
its expansion of
&consvars; like
<envar>$TARGET</envar>
and
<envar>$SOURCE</envar>
when using the <parameter>chdir</parameter>
keyword argument--that is,
the expanded file names
will still be relative to
the top-level directory where &SConstruct; was found,
and consequently incorrect
relative to the chdir directory.
If you use the <parameter>chdir</parameter> keyword argument,
you will typically need to supply a different
command line using
expansions like
<literal>${TARGET.file}</literal>
and
<literal>${SOURCE.file}</literal>
to use just the filename portion of the
targets and source.</para>

<para>&scons;
predefines the following builder methods.
Depending on the setup of a particular
&consenv; and on the type and software
installation status of the underlying system,
not all builders may be available to that
&consenv;.</para>

<para>All
targets of builder methods automatically depend on their sources.
An explicit dependency can
be specified using the
&f-link-env-Depends;
method of a &consenv; (see below).</para>

<para>In addition,
&scons;
automatically scans
source files for various programming languages,
so the dependencies do not need to be specified explicitly.
By default, SCons can
C source files,
C++ source files,
Fortran source files with
<filename>.F</filename>
(POSIX systems only),
<filename>.fpp</filename>,
or
<filename>.FPP</filename>
file extensions,
and assembly language files with
<filename>.S</filename>
(POSIX systems only),
<filename>.spp</filename>,
or
<filename>.SPP</filename>
files extensions
for C preprocessor dependencies.
SCons also has default support
for scanning D source files,
You can also write your own Scanners
to add support for additional source file types.
These can be added to the default
Scanner object used by the
&b-link-Object;, &b-link-StaticObject; and &b-link-SharedObject;
Builders by adding them
to the
<classname>SourceFileScanner</classname>
object.
See <xref linkend="scanner_objects"/>

<refsect2 id='methods_and_functions_to_do_things'>
<title>Methods and Functions To Do Things</title>

<para>In addition to Builder methods,
&scons;
provides a number of other &consenv; methods
and global functions to
manipulate the build configuration.</para>

<para>Usually, a &consenv; method
and global function with the same name both exist
for convenience.
In the following list, the global function
is documented in this style:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
<function>Function</function>(<parameter>arguments, [optional arguments]</parameter>)
</programlisting>

<para>and the &consenv; method looks like:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
<replaceable>env</replaceable>.<methodname>Function</methodname>(<parameter>arguments, [optional arguments]</parameter>)
</programlisting>

<para>If the function can be called both ways,
then both forms are listed.</para>

<para>The global function and same-named
&consenv; method
provide almost identical functionality, with a couple of exceptions.
First, many of the &consenv; methods affect only that
&consenv;, while the global function has a
global effect. Second, where appropriate,
calling the functionality through a &consenv; will
substitute &consvars; into
any supplied string arguments, while the global function doesn't have the
context of a &consenv; to pick variables from,
so it cannot perform the substitution.
For example:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
Default('$FOO')

env = Environment(FOO='foo')
env.Default('$FOO')
</programlisting>

<para>In the above example,
the call to the global &f-Default;
function will add a target named
<emphasis role="bold">$FOO</emphasis>
to the list of default targets,
while the call to the
&f-env-Default; &consenv; method
will expand the value
and add a target named
<emphasis role="bold">foo</emphasis>
to the list of default targets.
For more on &consvar; expansion,
see the next section on
&consvars;.</para>

<para>Global functions may be called from custom Python modules that you
import into an SConscript file by adding the following import
to the Python module:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
from SCons.Script import *
</programlisting>

<refsect2 id='sconscript_variables'>
<title>SConscript Variables</title>

<para>In addition to the global functions and methods,
&scons;
supports a number of variables
that can be used in SConscript files
to affect how you want the build to be performed.</para>

<variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
  <term>&ARGLIST;</term>
  <listitem>
<para>A list of the
<emphasis>keyword</emphasis>=<emphasis>value</emphasis>
arguments specified on the command line.
Each element in the list is a tuple
containing the argument.
The separate
<emphasis>keyword</emphasis>
and
<emphasis>value</emphasis>
elements of the tuple
can be accessed by
subscripting for elements
<emphasis role="bold">[0]</emphasis>
and
<emphasis role="bold">[1]</emphasis>
of the tuple, or, more readably, by using tuple unpacking.
Example:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
print("first keyword, value =", ARGLIST[0][0], ARGLIST[0][1])
print("second keyword, value =", ARGLIST[1][0], ARGLIST[1][1])
key, value = ARGLIST[2]
print("third keyword, value =", key, value)
for key, value in ARGLIST:
    # process key and value
</programlisting>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
  <term>&ARGUMENTS;</term>
  <listitem>
<para>A dictionary of all the
<emphasis>keyword</emphasis>=<emphasis>value</emphasis>
arguments specified on the command line.
The dictionary is not in order,
and if a given keyword has
more than one value assigned to it
on the command line,
the last (right-most) value is
the one in the &ARGUMENTS;
dictionary.</para>

<para>Example:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
if ARGUMENTS.get('debug', 0):
    env = Environment(CCFLAGS='-g')
else:
    env = Environment()
</programlisting>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
  <term>&BUILD_TARGETS;</term>
  <listitem>
<para>A list of the targets which
&scons;
has been asked to build.
The contents will be either those targets listed
on the command line, or, if none, those targets set
via calls to the &f-link-Default; function.
It does
<emphasis>not</emphasis>
contain any dependent targets that &scons;
selects for building as a result of making the sure the
specified targets are up to date, if those targets
did not appear on the command line.
The list is empty if neither
command line targets or &Default; calls are present.
</para>
<para>
The elements of this list may be strings
<emphasis>or</emphasis>
nodes, so you should run the list through the Python
<function>str</function>
function to make sure any Node path names
are converted to strings.</para>

<para>Because this list may be taken from the
list of targets specified using the
&Default; function,
the contents of the list may change
on each successive call to &Default;.
See the
&DEFAULT_TARGETS; list, below,
for additional information.</para>

<para>Example:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
if 'foo' in BUILD_TARGETS:
    print("Don't forget to test the `foo' program!")
if 'special/program' in BUILD_TARGETS:
    SConscript('special')
</programlisting>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
  <term>&COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS;</term>
  <listitem>
<para>A list of the targets explicitly specified on
the command line. If there are command line targets,
this list will have the same contents as &BUILD_TARGETS;.
If there are no targets specified on the command line,
the list is empty. The elements of this list are strings.
This can be used, for example,
to take specific actions only
when certain targets are explicitly being built.</para>

<para>Example:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
if 'foo' in COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS:
    print("Don't forget to test the `foo' program!")
if 'special/program' in COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS:
    SConscript('special')
</programlisting>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
  <term>&DEFAULT_TARGETS;</term>
  <listitem>
<para>A list of the target
<emphasis>nodes</emphasis>
that have been specified using the
&f-link-Default;
function. If there are no command line
targets, this list will have the same contents as
&BUILD_TARGETS;.
Since the elements of the list are nodes,
you need to call the Python
<function>str</function>
function on them to get the path name for each Node.</para>

<para>Example:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
print(str(DEFAULT_TARGETS[0]))
if 'foo' in [str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS]:
    print("Don't forget to test the `foo' program!")
</programlisting>

<para>The contents of the
&DEFAULT_TARGETS;
list change on on each successive call to the
&Default; function:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
print([str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])   # originally []
Default('foo')
print([str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])   # now a node ['foo']
Default('bar')
print([str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])   # now a node ['foo', 'bar']
Default(None)
print([str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])   # back to []
</programlisting>

<para>Consequently, be sure to use
&DEFAULT_TARGETS;
only after you've made all of your
&Default;() calls,
or else simply be careful of the order
of these statements in your SConscript files
so that you don't look for a specific
default target before it's actually been added to the list.</para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>
These variables may be accessed from custom Python modules that you
import into an SConscript file by adding the following
to the Python module:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
from SCons.Script import *

Customarily, the name chosen is <quote><filename>config.h</filename></quote>.
The default is to not write a
<parameter>config_h</parameter>
file.
You can specify the same
<parameter>config_h</parameter>
file in multiple calls to &Configure;,
in which case &SCons;
will concatenate all results in the specified file.
Note that &SCons;
uses its normal dependency checking
to decide if it's necessary to rebuild
the specified
<parameter>config_h</parameter>
file.
This means that the file is not necessarily re-built each
time scons is run,
but is only rebuilt if its contents will have changed
and some target that depends on the
<parameter>config_h</parameter>
file is being built.</para>
<para>The <parameter>clean</parameter>
and
<parameter>help</parameter>
arguments can be used to suppress execution of the configuration
tests when the
<option>-c</option>/<option>--clean</option>
or
<option>-H</option>/<option>-h</option>/<option>--help</option>
options are used, respectively.
The default behavior is always to execute
&configure_context; tests,
since the results of the tests may
affect the list of targets to be cleaned
or the help text.
If the configure tests do not affect these,
then you may add the
<option>clean=False</option>
or
<option>help=False</option>
arguments
(or both)
to avoid unnecessary test execution.</para>

<para>This method must be called after configuration is done.

<title>Command-Line Construction Variables</title>

<para>Often when building software,
some variables need to be specified at build time.
For example, libraries needed for the build may be in non-standard
locations, or site-specific compiler options may need to be passed to the
compiler.
&SCons;
provides a <firstterm>&Variables;</firstterm>
object to support overriding &consvars;
on the command line:</para>

<screen>
<userinput>scons VARIABLE=foo</userinput>

<para>The variable values can also be specified in an SConscript file.</para>

<para>To obtain the object for manipulating values,
call the &Variables; function:</para>

<variablelist>

  <term><function>Variables</function>([<parameter>files, [args]]</parameter>)</term>
  <listitem>
<para>If <parameter>files</parameter> is a file or
list of files, those are executed as Python scripts,
and the values of (global) Python variables set in
those files are added as &consvars; in the &DefEnv;.
If no files are specified,
or the
<parameter>files</parameter>
argument is
<constant>None</constant>,
then no files will be read. The following example file
contents could be used to set an alternative C compiler:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
CC = 'my_cc'

<para>If
<parameter>args</parameter>
is specified, it is a dictionary of
values that will override anything read from
<parameter>files</parameter>.
it is primarily intended to be passed the
&ARGUMENTS; dictionary that holds variables
specified on the command line.
Example:</para>

<parameter>default</parameter>
is the default value of the variable;
if the default value is
<constant>None</constant>
and there is no explicit value specified,
the &consvar; will not
be added to the &consenv;.
If set, <parameter>validator</parameter>
is called to validate the value of the variable.
A function supplied as a validator shall accept
arguments: <parameter>key</parameter>,
<parameter>value</parameter>, and <parameter>env</parameter>.
The recommended way to handle an invalid value is
to raise an exception (see example below).
If set, <parameter>converter</parameter>
is called to convert the value before putting it in the environment, and
should take either a value, or the value and environment, as parameters.
The converter function must return a value,

The <parameter>args</parameter>

for an individual call to the &Add; method.
Since tuples are not Python mappings,
the arguments cannot use the keyword form,
but rather are positional arguments as documented
for &Add;: a required name, the rest optional
but must be in the specified in order if used.

You can also explicitly create Action objects
for passing to &f-Builder;, or other functions

by calling the &f-link-Action; factory function.
This can be used to configure
an Action object more flexibly,
or it may simply be more efficient
than letting each separate Builder object
create a separate Action

<para>The
&Action; factory function

(the first positional parmeter):</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
<para>If the action argument is already an Action object,
the object is simply returned.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
<para>If the action argument is a string,
a command-line Action is returned.
If such a string begins with
<emphasis role="bold">@</emphasis>,
it indicates printing of the command line is to be suppressed.
If the string begins with

<para>If the action argument is a list,

An Action object is created as necessary

If an element

the list is itself a list,
the internal list is taken as the

This allows white space to be enclosed

<programlisting language="python">

<para>The function should return
<literal>0</literal>
or
<constant>None</constant>
to indicate a successful build of the target file(s).
The function may raise an exception
or return a non-zero exit status
to indicate an unsuccessful build.</para>

<programlisting language="python">

<para>If the action argument is not one of the above types,

<para>As usual the environment method form &f-link-env-Action;
will expand &consvars; in any argument strings, 
including the action argument, at the time it is called,
using the construction variables in the &consenv; through which
it was called. The global function form &f-link-Action;
<emphasis>delays</emphasis> variable expansion until
the Action object is actually used.
</para>

<para>The second argument to &f-Action;
is optional and is used to define the output
which is printed when the Action is actually performed.
In the absence of this parameter,
or if it's an empty string,
a default output depending on the type of the action is used.
For example, a command-line action will print the executed command.
The argument must be either a Python function or a string:</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
<para>If the output argument is a function,
it must return a string
describing the action being executed.
A function may also be specified using the
<parameter>strfunction</parameter>
keyword argument. The function
must accept these three keyword arguments:</para>

  <simplelist type="vert">
  <member><parameter>source</parameter> -
    a Node object representing the source file.</member>
  <member><parameter>target</parameter> -
    a Node object representing the target file.</member>

more than one target file or source file.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
<para>If the output argument is a string,
substitution is performed on it before it is printed.
The output string may also be specified using the
<parameter>cmdstr</parameter>
keyword argument.
The string typically contains variables, notably
<literal>$TARGET(S)</literal> and <literal>$SOURCE(S)</literal>,
or consists of just a single
variable, which is optionally defined somewhere else.
SCons itself heavily uses the latter variant.</para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Examples:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
def build_it(target, source, env):
    # build the target from the source
    return 0

def string_it(target, source, env):

# Use a positional argument.
f = Action(build_it, string_it)
s = Action(build_it, "building '$TARGET' from '$SOURCE'")

# Alternatively, use a keyword argument.
f = Action(build_it, strfunction=string_it)
s = Action(build_it, cmdstr="building '$TARGET' from '$SOURCE'")

# You can provide a configurable variable.
l = Action(build_it, '$STRINGIT')
</programlisting>

<para>Any additional positional arguments, if present,
may either be &consvars; or lists of &consvars;
whose values will be included in the signature of the Action
when deciding whether a target should be rebuilt because the action changed.
Such variables may also be specified using the
<parameter>varlist</parameter>
keyword parameter;
both positional and keyword forms may be present, and will be combined.
This is necessary whenever you want a target to be rebuilt
when a specific &consvar; changes.
This is not often needed for a string action,
as the expanded variables will normally be part of the command line,
but may be needed if a Python function action uses
the value of a &consvar; when generating the command line.</para>

<programlisting language="python">
def build_it(target, source, env):
    # build the target from the 'XXX' construction variable
    with open(target[0], 'w') as f:
        f.write(env['XXX'])
    return 0

# Use positional arguments.
a = Action(build_it, '$STRINGIT', ['XXX'])

# Alternatively, use a keyword argument.
a = Action(build_it, varlist=['XXX'])

<para>The
&Action;
factory function
can be passed the following
optional keyword arguments
to modify the Action object's behavior:</para>

<variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
  <term><parameter>chdir</parameter></term>
  <listitem>
<para>
Specifies that
scons will execute the action
after changing to the specified directory.
If the
<parameter>chdir</parameter>
argument is
a string or a directory Node,
scons will change to the specified directory.
If the
<parameter>chdir</parameter>
argument
is not a string or Node
and is non-zero,
then scons will change to the
target file's directory.</para>

<para>Note that scons will
<emphasis>not</emphasis>
automatically modify
its expansion of
&consvars; like
&cv-TARGET; and &cv-SOURCE;
when using the <parameter>chdir</parameter>
keyword argument--that is,
the expanded file names
will still be relative to
the top-level directory containing the &SConstruct; file,
and consequently incorrect
relative to the chdir directory.
Builders created using <parameter>chdir</parameter> keyword argument,
will need to use &consvar;
expansions like

  <listitem>
<para>
A function

(or return value)
from the specified action
and can return an arbitrary
or modified value.
This can be used, for example,
to specify that an Action object's
return value should be ignored
under special conditions
and SCons should, therefore,
consider that the action always succeeds. Example:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
def always_succeed(s):
    # Always return 0, which indicates success.
    return 0

a = Action("build &lt; ${SOURCE.file} &gt; ${TARGET.file}",

</programlisting>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
  <term><parameter>batch_key</parameter></term>
  <listitem>
<para>
Specifies that the Action can create multiple target files
by processing multiple independent source files simultaneously.
(The canonical example is "batch compilation"
of multiple object files
by passing multiple source files
to a single invocation of a compiler
such as Microsoft's Visual C / C++ compiler.)
If the
<parameter>batch_key</parameter>
argument evaluates True and is not a callable object,
the configured Action object will cause
&scons;
to collect all targets built with the Action object
and configured with the same &consenv;
into single invocations of the Action object's
command line or function.
Command lines will typically want to use the
&cv-CHANGED_SOURCES; &consvar;
(and possibly &cv-CHANGED_TARGETS; as well)
to only pass to the command line those sources that
have actually changed since their targets were built.
Example:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
a = Action('build $CHANGED_SOURCES', batch_key=True)
</programlisting>

<para>The
<parameter>batch_key</parameter>
argument may also be
a callable function
that returns a key that
will be used to identify different
"batches" of target files to be collected
for batch building.
A
<parameter>batch_key</parameter>
function must accept the following arguments:</para>

  <simplelist>
  <member><parameter>action</parameter> - The action object.</member>
  <member><parameter>env</parameter> -
    The &consenv; configured for the target.</member>
  <member><parameter>target</parameter> -
    The list of targets for a particular configured action.</member>
  <member><parameter>source</parameter> -
    The list of source for a particular configured action.</member>
  </simplelist>

<para>The returned key should typically
be a tuple of values derived from the arguments,
using any appropriate logic to decide
how multiple invocations should be batched.
For example, a
<function>batch_key</function>
function may decide to return
the value of a specific construction
variable from the
<parameter>env</parameter>
argument
which will cause
&scons;
to batch-build targets
with matching values of that variable,
or perhaps return the
Python <function>id</function>()
of the entire &consenv;,
in which case
&scons;
will batch-build
all targets configured with the same &consenv;.
Returning
<constant>None</constant>
indicates that
the particular target should
<emphasis>not</emphasis>
be part of any batched build,
but instead will be built
by a separate invocation of action's
command or function.
Example:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
def batch_key(action, env, target, source):
    tdir = target[0].dir
    if tdir.name == 'special':
        # Don't batch-build any target
        # in the special/ subdirectory.
        return None
    return (id(action), id(env), tdir)
a = Action('build $CHANGED_SOURCES', batch_key=batch_key)

<para>&scons;

These are similar in concept to "tasks" in the

These functions do not actually
perform the specified action

<para>Second,
you can use these functions

<title>Variable Substitution</title>

<para>Before executing a command,

performs &consvar; substitution on the string that makes up
the command line of the builder.
&Consvars; to be interpolated are indicated in the

which is not to be substituted.
Besides regular &consvars;, scons provides the following
special variables for each command execution:</para>

<variablelist>

  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>Note that the above variables are reserved
and may not be assigned to in the &consenv;.</para>

<para>For example, given the &consvars;
<literal>CC='cc'</literal>,
<literal>targets=['foo']</literal>
and
<literal>sources=['foo.c', 'bar.c']</literal>:
</para>

<programlisting language="python">
action='$CC -c -o $TARGET $SOURCES'
</programlisting>

<para>would produce the command line:</para>

<screen>
cc -c -o foo foo.c bar.c
</screen>

<para>Variable names may be surrounded by curly braces
(<emphasis role="bold">{}</emphasis>)
to separate the name from surrounding characters which
are not part of the name.
Within the curly braces, a variable name may use
Python list subscripting/slicing notation to select one
or more items from a list.
In the previous example, the string:
<code>${SOURCES[1]}</code>
would produce:</para>

<screen>
bar.c
</screen>

<para>Additionally, a variable name may
have the following
modifiers appended within the enclosing curly braces
to access properties of the interpolated string:</para>

<simplelist>
  <member><parameter>base</parameter> -
    The base path of the file name,
    including the directory path
    but excluding any suffix.
  </member>
  <member><parameter>dir</parameter> - The name of the directory in which the file exists.</member>
  <member><parameter>file</parameter> -  The file name, minus any directory portion.</member>
  <member><parameter>filebase</parameter> - Like <parameter>file</parameter> but minus its suffix.</member>
  <member><parameter>suffix</parameter> - Just the file suffix.</member>
  <member><parameter>abspath</parameter> - The absolute path name of the file.</member>
  <member><parameter>posix</parameter> -
    The path with directories separated by forward slashes
    (<emphasis role="bold">/</emphasis>).
    Sometimes necessary on Windows systems
    when a path references a file on other (POSIX) systems.
  </member>
  <member><parameter>windows</parameter> -
    The path with directories separated by backslashes
    (<emphasis role="bold"><literal>\\</literal></emphasis>).
    Sometimes necessary on POSIX-style systems
    when a path references a file on other (Windows) systems.
    <parameter>win32</parameter> is a (deprecated) synonym for
    <parameter>windows</parameter>.
  </member>
  <member><parameter>srcpath</parameter> -
    The directory and file name to the source file linked to this file through
    &f-VariantDir;().
    If this file isn't linked,
    it just returns the directory and filename unchanged.
  </member>
  <member><parameter>srcdir</parameter> -
    The directory containing the source file linked to this file through
    &f-VariantDir;().
    If this file isn't linked,
    it just returns the directory part of the filename.
  </member>
  <member><parameter>rsrcpath</parameter> -
    The directory and file name to the source file linked to this file through
    &f-VariantDir;().
    If the file does not exist locally but exists in a Repository,
    the path in the Repository is returned.
    If this file isn't linked, it just returns the
    directory and filename unchanged.
  </member>
  <member><parameter>rsrcdir</parameter> -
    The Repository directory containing the source file linked to this file through
    &VariantDir;().
    If this file isn't linked,
    it just returns the directory part of the filename.
  </member>
</simplelist>

<para>For example, the specified target will
expand as follows for the corresponding modifiers:</para>

<literallayout class="monospaced">
$TARGET              =&gt; sub/dir/file.x
${TARGET.base}       =&gt; sub/dir/file
${TARGET.dir}        =&gt; sub/dir
${TARGET.file}       =&gt; file.x
${TARGET.filebase}   =&gt; file
${TARGET.suffix}     =&gt; .x
${TARGET.abspath}    =&gt; /top/dir/sub/dir/file.x

SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='sub/dir')
$SOURCE              =&gt; sub/dir/file.x
${SOURCE.srcpath}    =&gt; src/file.x
${SOURCE.srcdir}     =&gt; src

Repository('/usr/repository')
$SOURCE              =&gt; sub/dir/file.x
${SOURCE.rsrcpath}   =&gt; /usr/repository/src/file.x
${SOURCE.rsrcdir}    =&gt; /usr/repository/src
</literallayout>

<para>
Modifiers can be combined, like
<literal>${TARGET.base.windows}</literal>,
<literal>${TARGET.srcpath.base)</literal>,
<literal>${TARGET.file.suffix}</literal>, etc.
</para>

<para>Note that curly braces braces may also be used
to enclose arbitrary Python code to be evaluated.
(In fact, this is how the above modifiers are substituted,
they are simply attributes of the Python objects
that represent &cv-TARGET;, &cv-SOURCES;, etc.)
See <xref linkend='python_code_substitution'/> below
for more thorough examples of
how this can be used.</para>

<para>Lastly, a variable name
may be a callable Python function
associated with a
&consvar; in the environment.
The function should
accept four arguments:
</para>
<simplelist>
  <member><parameter>target</parameter> - a list of target nodes</member>
  <member><parameter>source</parameter> - a list of source nodes</member>
  <member><parameter>env</parameter> - the &consenv;</member>
  <member><parameter>for_signature</parameter> -
    a Boolean value that specifies
    whether the function is being called
    for generating a build signature.
  </member>
</simplelist>

<para>
SCons will insert whatever
the called function returns
into the expanded string:
</para>

<programlisting language="python">
def foo(target, source, env, for_signature):
    return "bar"

# Will expand $BAR to "bar baz"
env=Environment(FOO=foo, BAR="$FOO baz")
</programlisting>

<para>You can use this feature to pass arguments to a
Python function by creating a callable class
that stores one or more arguments in an object,
and then uses them when the
<methodname>__call__()</methodname>
method is called.
Note that in this case,
the entire variable expansion must
be enclosed by curly braces
so that the arguments will
be associated with the
instantiation of the class:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
class foo:
    def __init__(self, arg):
        self.arg = arg

    def __call__(self, target, source, env, for_signature):
        return self.arg + " bar"

# Will expand $BAR to "my argument bar baz"
env=Environment(FOO=foo, BAR="${FOO('my argument')} baz")
</programlisting>


<para>The special pseudo-variables
<emphasis role="bold">$(</emphasis>
and
<emphasis role="bold">$)</emphasis>
may be used to surround parts of a command line
that may change
<emphasis>without</emphasis>
causing a rebuild--that is,
which are not included in the signature
of target files built with this command.
All text between
<emphasis role="bold">$(</emphasis>
and
<emphasis role="bold">$)</emphasis>
will be removed from the command line
before it is added to file signatures,
and the
<emphasis role="bold">$(</emphasis>
and
<emphasis role="bold">$)</emphasis>
will be removed before the command is executed.
For example, the command line:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
echo Last build occurred $( $TODAY $). &gt; $TARGET
</programlisting>

<para>would execute the command:</para>

<screen>
echo Last build occurred $TODAY. &gt; $TARGET
</screen>

<para>but the command signature added to any target files would be:</para>

<screen>
echo Last build occurred  . &gt; $TARGET
</screen>

</refsect2>

<refsect2 id='python_code_substitution'>
<title>Python Code Substitution</title>

<para>
Any Python code within curly braces
(<emphasis role="bold">{}</emphasis>)
and introduced by the variable prefix <literal>$</literal>
will be evaluated using the Python <function>eval</function> statement,
with the Python globals set to
the current environment's set of &consvars;, and the result
substituted in.
So in the following case:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env['COND'] = 0
env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in',
    '''echo ${COND==1 and 'FOO' or 'BAR'} &gt; $TARGET''')
</programlisting>

<para>the command executed will be either</para>

<screen>
echo FOO &gt; foo.out
</screen>

<para>or</para>

<screen>
echo BAR &gt; foo.out
</screen>

<para>according to the current value of <literal>env['COND']</literal>
when the command is executed.
The evaluation takes place when the target is being
built, not when the SConscript is being read.  So if
<literal>env['COND']</literal> is changed
later in the SConscript, the final value will be used.</para>

<para>Here's a more interesting example.  Note that all of
<envar>COND</envar>,
<envar>FOO</envar>,
and
<envar>BAR</envar> are &consvars;,
and their values are substituted into the final command.
<envar>FOO</envar> is a list, so its elements are interpolated
separated by spaces.</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env=Environment()
env['COND'] = 0
env['FOO'] = ['foo1', 'foo2']
env['BAR'] = 'barbar'
env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in',
    'echo ${COND==1 and FOO or BAR} &gt; $TARGET')

# Will execute this:
#  echo foo1 foo2 &gt; foo.out
</programlisting>

<para>SCons uses the following rules when converting &consvars; into
command lines:</para>

<variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
  <term>string</term>
  <listitem>
<para>When the value is a string it is interpreted as a space delimited list of
command line arguments.</para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
  <term>list</term>
  <listitem>
<para>When the value is a list it is interpreted as a list of command line
arguments. Each element of the list is converted to a string.</para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
  <term>other</term>
  <listitem>
<para>Anything that is not a list or string is converted to a string and
interpreted as a single command line argument.</para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
  <term>newline</term>
  <listitem>
<para>Newline characters (<literal>\n</literal>) delimit lines.
The newline parsing is done after
all other parsing, so it is not possible for arguments (e.g. file names) to
contain embedded newline characters.</para>

</refsect2>

<refsect2 id='scanner_objects'>
<title>Scanner Objects</title>

<para>You can use the

<para>If the argument is a Python function,
the function must accept three required arguments
and an optional fourth:
</para>

<title>Windows: Cygwin Tools and Cygwin Python vs. Windows Pythons</title>

<para>Cygwin supplies a set of tools and utilities
that let users work on a
Windows system using a more POSIX-like environment.
The Cygwin tools, including Cygwin Python,
do this, in part,
by sharing an ability to interpret UNIX-like path names.
For example, the Cygwin tools
will internally translate a Cygwin path name
like <filename>/cygdrive/c/mydir</filename>
to an equivalent Windows pathname
of <filename>C:/mydir</filename> (equivalent to <filename>C:\mydir</filename>).
</para>

<para>Versions of Python
that are built for native Windows execution,
such as the python.org and ActiveState versions,
do not have the Cygwin path name semantics.
This means that using a native Windows version of Python
to build compiled programs using Cygwin tools
(such as &gcc;, &bison; and <application>flex</application>)
may yield unpredictable results.
"Mixing and matching" in this way
can be made to work,
but it requires careful attention to the use of path names
in your SConscript files.</para>

<para>In practice, users can sidestep
the issue by adopting the following rules:
When using &gcc;,
use the Cygwin-supplied Python interpreter
to run &scons;;
when using Microsoft Visual C/C++
(or some other Windows compiler)
use the python.org or Microsoft Store or ActiveState version of Python
to run &scons;.</para>

<para>First, Windows command-line users
that want to use variable assignment
on the command line
may have to put double quotes
around the assignments:</para>

<screen>
<userinput>scons "FOO=BAR" "BAZ=BLEH"</userinput>
</screen>

<para>Second, the Cygwin shell does not
recognize this file as being the same
as an &scons;
command issued at the command-line prompt.
You can work around this either by
executing
<filename>scons.bat</filename>
from the Cygwin command line,
or by creating a wrapper shell
script named
<filename>scons</filename>.</para>

<refsect2 id='mingw'>

Python interpreter, &scons; will prefer the MinGW tools over the Cygwin
tools, if they are both installed, regardless of the order of the bin
directories in the <envar>PATH</envar> variable.
If you have both MSVC and MinGW
installed and you want to use MinGW instead of MSVC,
then you must explicitly tell &scons; to use MinGW by passing

<refsect2 id='defining_your_own_scanner_object'>
<title>Defining Your Own Scanner Object</title>

<para>The following example shows adding an extremely simple scanner
(<function>kfile_scan</function>)
that doesn't use a search path at all
and simply returns the
file names present on any
<literal>include</literal>
lines in the scanned file.
This would implicitly assume that all included
files live in the top-level directory:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
import re

include_re = re.compile(r'^include\s+(\S+)$', re.M)

def kfile_scan(node, env, path, arg):
    contents = node.get_text_contents()
    includes = include_re.findall(contents)
    return env.File(includes)

kscan = Scanner(
    name='kfile',
    function=kfile_scan,
    argument=None,
    skeys=['.k'],
)

scanners = DefaultEnvironment()['SCANNERS']
scanners.append(kscan)
env = Environment(SCANNERS=scanners)

env.Command('foo', 'foo.k', 'kprocess &lt; $SOURCES &gt; $TARGET')

bar_in = File('bar.in')
env.Command('bar', bar_in, 'kprocess $SOURCES &gt; $TARGET')
bar_in.target_scanner = kscan
</programlisting>

<para>It is important to note that you
have to return a list of File nodes from the scan function, simple
strings for the file names won't do. As in the examples shown here,
you can use the &f-link-env-File;
function of your current &consenv; in order to create nodes on the fly from
a sequence of file names with relative paths.</para>

<para>Here is a similar but more complete example that adds
a scanner which searches
a path of directories
(specified as the
<envar>MYPATH</envar> &consvar;)
for files that actually exist:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
import re
import os

include_re = re.compile(r'^include\s+(\S+)$', re.M)

def my_scan(node, env, path, arg):
    contents = node.get_text_contents()
    includes = include_re.findall(contents)
    if not includes:
        return []
    results = []
    for inc in includes:
        for dir in path:
            file = str(dir) + os.sep + inc
            if os.path.exists(file):
                results.append(file)
                break
    return env.File(results)

scanner = Scanner(
    name='myscanner',
    function=my_scan,
    argument=None,
    skeys=['.x'],
    path_function=FindPathDirs('MYPATH'),
)

scanners = DefaultEnvironment()['SCANNERS']
scanners.append(scanner)
env = Environment(SCANNERS=scanners, MYPATH=['incs'])

env.Command('foo', 'foo.x', 'xprocess &lt; $SOURCES &gt; $TARGET')
</programlisting>

<para>The
&f-link-FindPathDirs;
function used in the previous example returns a function
(actually a callable Python object)
that will return a list of directories
specified in the
<envar>MYPATH</envar>
&consvar;. It lets &scons; detect the file
<filename>incs/foo.inc</filename>,
even if
<filename>foo.x</filename>
contains the line
<literal>include foo.inc</literal>
only.
If you need to customize how the search path is derived,
you would provide your own
<parameter>path_function</parameter>
argument when creating the Scanner object,
as follows:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
# MYPATH is a list of directories to search for files in
def pf(env, dir, target, source, arg):
    top_dir = Dir('#').abspath
    results = []
    if 'MYPATH' in env:
        for p in env['MYPATH']:
            results.append(top_dir + os.sep + p)
    return results


scanner = Scanner(
    name='myscanner',
    function=my_scan,
    argument=None,
    skeys=['.x'],
    path_function=pf
)

<title>Using Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled headers</title>

<para>Since <filename>windows.h</filename> includes everything
and the kitchen sink, it can take quite
some time to compile it over and over again for a bunch of object files, so
Microsoft provides a mechanism to compile a set of headers once and then
include the previously compiled headers in any object file. This
technology is called precompiled headers (<firstterm>PCH</firstterm>).
The general recipe is to create a
file named <filename>StdAfx.cpp</filename>
that includes a single header named <filename>StdAfx.h</filename>,
and then include every header you want to precompile in
<filename>StdAfx.h</filename>,
and finally include <filename>"StdAfx.h</filename>
as the first header in all the source files you are
compiling to object files. For example:</para>

<para><filename>StdAfx.h</filename>:</para>

<programlisting language="C++">
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;my_big_header.h&gt;

<para>Note: use this cache with caution as it
might be somewhat fragile: while each major toolset version
(e.g. Visual Studio 2017 vs 2019) and architecture pair will get separate
cache entries, if toolset updates cause a change
to settings within a given release series, &scons; will not
detect the change and will reuse old settings.
Remove the cache file in case of problems with this.
&scons; will ignore failures reading or writing the file
