<title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<para>
&scons;
orchestrates the construction of software
(and other tangible products such as documentation files)
by determining which
component pieces must be built or rebuilt and invoking the necessary
commands to build them.
&SCons; offers many features to improve developer productivity
such as parallel builds, caching of build artifacts,
automatic dependency scanning,
and a database of information about previous builds so
details do not have to be recalculated each run.
</para>

<para>&scons; requires &Python; 3.6 or later to run;
there should be no other dependencies or requirements,
unless the experimental Ninja tool is used.
</para>
<para>
<emphasis>Changed in version 4.3.0:</emphasis>
support for &Python; 3.5 is removed;
the CPython project has retired 3.5:
<ulink url="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0478"/>.
</para>

<para>You set up an &SCons;
build system by writing a script
that describes things to build (<firstterm>targets</firstterm>), and,
if necessary, the rules to build those files (<firstterm>actions</firstterm>).
&SCons; comes with a collection of <firstterm>Builder</firstterm> methods
which apply premade actions for building many common software components
such as executable programs, object files and libraries,
so that for many software projects,
only the targets and input files (<firstterm>sources</firstterm>)
need be specified in a call to a builder.
&SCons; thus can operate at a level of abstraction above that of pure filenames.
For example if you specify a library target named "foo",
&SCons; keeps track of the actual operating system dependent filename
(such as <filename>libfoo.so</filename> on a GNU/Linux system),
and how to refer to that library in later construction steps
that want to use it, so you don't have to specify that precise
information yourself.
&SCons; can also scan automatically for dependency information,
such as header files included by source code files
(for example, <literal>#include</literal>
preprocessor directives in C or C++ files),
so these <firstterm>implicit dependencies</firstterm> do not
have to be specified manually.
&SCons; supports the ability to define new scanners
to support additional input file types.
</para>

<para>Information about files involved in the build,
including a cryptographic hash of the contents of source files,
is cached for later reuse.
By default this hash (the <firstterm>&contentsig;</firstterm>)
is used to determine if a file has changed since the last build,
although this can be controlled by selecting an appropriate
<firstterm>&f-link-Decider;</firstterm> function.
Implicit dependency files are also part of out-of-date computation.
The scanned implicit dependency information can optionally be
cached and used to speed up future builds.
A hash of each executed build action (the <firstterm>&buildsig;</firstterm>)
is cached, so that changes to build instructions (changing flags, etc.)
or to the build tools themselves (new version)
can also trigger a rebuild.
</para>

<para>
&SCons; supports the concept of separated source and build
directories through the definition of
<firstterm>variant directories</firstterm>
(see the &f-link-VariantDir; function).
</para>

<para>
When invoked, &scons;
looks for a file named
&SConstruct;
in the current directory and reads the
build configuration from that file
(other names are allowed,
see <xref linkend="sconscript_files"/>
and the <link linkend="opt-f"><option>-f</option></link> option
for more information).
The build may be structured in a hierarchical manner:
the &SConstruct;
file may specify subsidiary
configuration files by calling the
&f-link-SConscript; function,
and these may, in turn, do the same.
By convention,
these subsidiary files are named
&SConscript;,
although any name may be used.
As a result of this naming convention,
the term <firstterm>&SConscript; files</firstterm>
is used to refer
generically to the complete set of
configuration files for a project
(including the &SConstruct; file),
regardless of the actual file names or number of such files.
A hierarchical build is not recursive - all of
the SConscript files are processed in a single pass,
although each is processed in a separate context so
as not to interfere with one another. &SCons; provides
mechanisms for information to be shared between
SConscript files when needed.
</para>

<para>Before reading the &SConscript; files,
&scons;
looks for a directory named
<filename>site_scons</filename>
in various system directories and in the directory containing the
&SConstruct; file
or, if specified, the
directory from the
<link linkend="opt-site-dir"><option>--site-dir</option></link>
option instead, and prepends the ones it
finds to the &Python; module search path (<varname>sys.path</varname>),
thus allowing modules in such directories to be imported in
the normal &Python; way in &SConscript; files.
For each found site directory,
(1) if it contains a file <filename>site_init.py</filename>
that file is evaluated,
and (2) if it contains a directory
<filename>site_tools</filename> the path to that directory
is prepended to the default toolpath.
See the
<link linkend="opt-site-dir"><option>--site-dir</option></link>
and
<link linkend="opt-no-site-dir"><option>--no-site-dir</option></link>
options for details on default paths and
controlling the site directories.
</para>

<para>
&SConscript; files are written in the
<firstterm>&Python;</firstterm> programming language,
although it is normally not necessary to be a &Python;
programmer to use &scons; effectively.
&SConscript; files are invoked in a context that makes
the facilities described in this manual page available
in their local namespace without any special steps.
Standard &Python; scripting capabilities
such as flow control, data manipulation, and imported &Python; libraries
are available to use to handle complicated build situations.
Other &Python; files can be made a part of the build system,
but they do not automatically have the &SCons; context and
need to import it if they need access (described later).
</para>

<para>
&scons;
reads and executes all of the included &SConscript; files
<emphasis>before</emphasis>
it begins building any targets.
To make this clear,
&scons;
prints the following messages about what it is doing:</para>

<screen>
$ <userinput>scons foo.out</userinput>
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets  ...
cp foo.in foo.out
scons: done building targets.
$
</screen>

<para>The status messages
(lines beginning with the <literal>scons:</literal> tag)
may be suppressed using the
<link linkend="opt-Q"><option>-Q</option></link>
option.</para>

<para>
To assure reproducible builds,
&SCons;
uses a restricted <firstterm>execution environment</firstterm>
for running external commands used to build targets,
rather then propagating the full environment
in effect at the time &scons; was called.
This helps avoid problems like picking up accidental settings,
temporary debug values that are no longer needed,
or one developer having different settings than another
(or than the CI/CD pipeline).
Environment variables that are needed for proper
operation of such commands need to be set explicitly,
which can be done either by assigning the desired values,
or by picking values individually out of environment variables
using the &Python; <systemitem>os.environ</systemitem> dictionary.
The execution environment for a given &consenv; is
contained in its &cv-link-ENV; &consvar;.
A few environment variables are picked up automatically -
see <xref linkend="environment"/>).
</para>

<para>
In particular, if the compiler or other commands
that you want to use to build your target files
are not in standard system locations,
&scons;
will not find them unless
you explicitly include the locations into the
<varname>PATH</varname> element of the
execution environment.
One example approach is to
extract the entire <envar>PATH</envar>
environment variable and set that into the
execution environment:
</para>

<programlisting language="python">
import os
env = Environment(ENV={'PATH': os.environ['PATH']})
</programlisting>

<para>Similarly, if the commands use specific
external environment variables that &scons;
does not recognize, they can be propagated into
the execution environment:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
import os

env = Environment(
    ENV={
        'PATH': os.environ['PATH'],
        'ANDROID_HOME': os.environ['ANDROID_HOME'],
        'ANDROID_NDK_HOME': os.environ['ANDROID_NDK_HOME'],
    }
)
</programlisting>

<para>Or you may explicitly propagate the invoking user's
complete external environment:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
import os
env = Environment(ENV=os.environ.copy())
</programlisting>

<para>This comes at the expense of making your build
dependent on the user's environment being set correctly,
but it may be more convenient for many configurations.
It should not cause problems if done in a build setup which tightly
controls how the environment is set up before invoking
&scons;, as in many continuous
integration setups.
</para>

<para>&scons;
is normally executed in a top-level directory containing an
&SConstruct; file.
When &scons; is invoked,
the command line (including the contents of the
<link linkend="v-SCONSFLAGS">&SCONSFLAGS;</link>
environment variable, if set) is processed.
Command-line options (see <xref linkend="options"/>) are consumed.
Any variable argument assignments are collected, and
remaining arguments are taken as targets to build.</para>

<para>Values of variables to be passed to the &SConscript; files
may be specified on the command line:</para>

<screen>
<userinput>scons debug=1</userinput>
</screen>

<para>These variables are available through the
<link linkend="v-ARGUMENTS">&ARGUMENTS;</link> dictionary,
and can be used in the &SConscript; files to modify
the build in any way:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
if ARGUMENTS.get('debug', 0):
    env = Environment(CCFLAGS='-g')
else:
    env = Environment()
</programlisting>

<para>The command-line variable arguments are also available
in the <link linkend="v-ARGLIST">&ARGLIST;</link> list,
indexed by their order on the command line.
This allows you to process them in order rather than by name,
if necessary. Each &ARGLIST; entry is a tuple containing
(<replaceable>argname</replaceable>, <replaceable>argvalue</replaceable>).
</para>

<para>
See <xref linkend="commandline_construction_variables"/>
for more information.
</para>

<para>&scons;
can maintain a cache of target (derived) files that can
be shared between multiple builds.  When derived-file caching is enabled in an
&SConscript; file, any target files built by
&scons;
will be copied
to the cache.  If an up-to-date target file is found in the cache, it
will be retrieved from the cache instead of being rebuilt locally.
Caching behavior may be disabled and controlled in other ways by the
<link linkend="opt-cache-force"><option>--cache-force</option></link>,
<link linkend="opt-cache-disable"><option>--cache-disable</option></link>,
<link linkend="opt-cache-readonly"><option>--cache-readonly</option></link>,
and
<link linkend="opt-cache-show"><option>--cache-show</option></link>
command-line options.  The
<link linkend="opt-random"><option>--random</option></link>
option is useful to prevent multiple builds
from trying to update the cache simultaneously.</para>

<!--  The following paragraph reflects the default tool search orders -->
<!--  currently in SCons/Tool/__init__.py.  If any of those search orders -->
<!--  change, this documentation should change, too. -->

<para>By default,
&scons;
searches for known programming tools
on various systems and initializes itself based on what is found.
On Windows systems which identify as <emphasis>win32</emphasis>,
&scons;
searches in order for the
Microsoft Visual C++ tools,
the MinGW tool chain,
the Intel compiler tools,
and the PharLap ETS compiler.
On Windows system which identify as <emphasis>cygwin</emphasis>
(that is, if &scons; is invoked from a cygwin shell),
the order changes to prefer the GCC toolchain over the MSVC tools.
On OS/2 systems,
&scons;
searches in order for the
OS/2 compiler,
the GCC tool chain,
and the Microsoft Visual C++ tools,
On SGI IRIX, IBM AIX, Hewlett Packard HP-UX, and Oracle Solaris systems,
&scons;
searches for the native compiler tools
(MIPSpro, Visual Age, aCC, and Forte tools respectively)
and the GCC tool chain.
On all other platforms,
including POSIX (Linux and UNIX) platforms,
&scons;
searches in order
for the GCC tool chain,
and the Intel compiler tools.
These default values may be overridden
by appropriate setting of &consvars;.</para>

<refsect2 id='target_selection'>
<title>Target Selection</title>

<para>&SCons; acts on the <firstterm>selected targets</firstterm>,
whether the requested operation is build, no-exec or clean.
Targets are selected as follows:
</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
Targets specified on the command line.
These may be files, directories,
or phony targets defined using the &f-link-Alias; function.
Directory targets are scanned by &scons; for any targets
that may be found with a destination in or under that directory.
The targets listed on the command line are made available in the
<link linkend="v-COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS">&COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS;</link> list.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>If no targets are specified on the command line,
&scons; will select those targets
specified in the &SConscript; files via calls
to the &f-link-Default; function. These are
known as the <firstterm>default targets</firstterm>,
and are made available in the
<link linkend="v-DEFAULT_TARGETS">&DEFAULT_TARGETS;</link> list.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
If no targets are selected by the previous steps,
&scons; selects the current directory for scanning,
unless command-line options which affect the directory
for target scanning are present
(<link linkend="opt-directory"><option>-C</option></link>,
<link linkend="opt-D"><option>-D</option></link>,
<link linkend="opt-up"><option>-u</option></link>,
<link linkend="opt-U"><option>-U</option></link>).
Since targets thus selected were not the result of
user instructions, this target list is not made available
for direct inspection; use the
<link linkend="opt-debug"><option>--debug=explain</option></link>
option if they need to be examined.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
&scons; always adds to the selected targets any intermediate
targets which are necessary to build the specified ones.
For example, if constructing a shared library or dll from C
source files, &scons; will also build the object files which
will make up the library.
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>To ignore the default targets specified
through calls to &Default; and instead build all
target files in or below the current directory
specify the current directory (<literal>.</literal>)
as a command-line target:</para>

<screen>
<userinput>scons .</userinput>
</screen>

<para>To build all target files,
including any files outside of the current directory,
supply a command-line target
of the root directory (on POSIX systems):</para>

<screen>
<userinput>scons /</userinput>
</screen>

<para>or the path name(s) of the volume(s) in which all the targets
should be built (on Windows systems):</para>

<screen>
<userinput>scons C:\ D:\</userinput>
</screen>

<para>A subset of a hierarchical tree may be built by
remaining at the top-level directory (where the
&SConstruct;
file lives) and specifying the subdirectory as the target to
build:</para>

<screen>
<userinput>scons src/subdir</userinput>
</screen>

<para>or by changing directory and invoking scons with the
<link linkend="opt-up"><option>-u</option></link>
option, which traverses up the directory
hierarchy until it finds the
&SConstruct;
file, and then builds
targets relatively to the current subdirectory (see
also the related
<link linkend="opt-D"><option>-D</option></link>
and
<link linkend="opt-U"><option>-U</option></link>
options):</para>

<screen>
<userinput>cd src/subdir</userinput>
<userinput>scons -u .</userinput>
</screen>

<para>In all cases, more files may be built than are
requested, as &scons; needs to make
sure any dependent files are built.</para>

<para>Specifying "cleanup" targets in &SConscript; files is
usually not necessary.
The
<link linkend="opt-clean"><option>-c</option></link>
flag removes all selected targets:
</para>

<screen>
<userinput>scons -c .</userinput>
</screen>

<para>to remove all target files in or under the current directory, or:</para>

<screen>
<userinput>scons -c build export</userinput>
</screen>

<para>to remove target files under <filename>build</filename>
and <filename>export</filename>.</para>

<para>
Additional files or directories to remove can be specified using the
&f-link-Clean; function in the &SConscript; files.
Conversely, targets that would normally be removed by the
<option>-c</option>
invocation can be retained by calling the
&f-link-NoClean; function with those targets.</para>

<para>&scons;
supports building multiple targets in parallel via a
<link linkend="opt-jobs"><option>-j</option></link>
option that takes, as its argument, the number
of simultaneous tasks that may be spawned:</para>

<screen>
<userinput>scons -j 4</userinput>
</screen>

<para>builds four targets in parallel, for example.</para>

work which is done directly in &Python; code in &SConscript; files
will still be carried out.  If it is important to avoid some

<link linkend="opt-sconstruct"><option>-f <replaceable>directory</replaceable>/SConstruct</option></link>,
but <option>-f</option> does not search for any of the
predefined &SConstruct; names
in the specified directory.

(When

When

<emphasis>with</emphasis>
the

and your build configuration allows good parallelization,
the elapsed wall-clock time should
be significantly smaller than the

<para>The supported list of values are:

<para>If this option is omitted,
the first supported hash format found is selected.
Typically this is MD5, however, on a FIPS-compliant system
using a version of &Python; older than 3.9,
SHA1 or SHA256 is chosen as the default.
&Python; 3.9 and onwards clients always default to MD5, even in FIPS mode.
</para>

<para>Specifying this option changes the name of the SConsign database.
The default database is <filename>.sconsign.dblite</filename>.
In the presence of this option,
<replaceable>ALGORITHM</replaceable> is
included in the name to indicate the difference,

The default value is 2 days, which means a file must have a
modification time of at least two days ago in order to have its
cached &contentsig; used.
A negative value means to never cache the
&contentsig; and to ignore the cached value if there already is one.
A value of 0 means to always use the cached signature,
no matter how old the file is.</para>

Only target building is suppressed - any work in the build
system that is done directly (in regular &Python; code)
will still be carried out. You can add guards around

<para>The output is a best effort, as &SCons; cannot always precisely
determine what would be built.  For example, if a file generated
by a builder action is also used as a source in the build,
that file is not available to scan for dependencies at all
in an unbuilt tree, and may contain out of date information in a
previously built tree.

so the last-executed <filename>site_init.py</filename> file is
the most specific one, giving it the chance to override
everything else), and the directories are prepended to the paths, again so

<para>
Using a stack size that is too small may cause stack overflow errors.
This usually shows up as segmentation faults that cause scons to abort
before building anything.  Using a stack size that is too large will
cause scons to use more memory than required and may slow down the entire
build process.
The default value is to use a stack size of 256 kilobytes, which should
be appropriate for most uses.  You should not need to increase this value

<title>SConscript Files</title>
<para>
The build configuration is described by one or more files,
known as &SConscript; files.
There must be at least one file for a valid build
(&scons; will quit if it does not find one).
&scons; by default looks for this file by the name
<filename>SConstruct</filename>
in the directory from which you run &scons;,
though if necessary, also looks for alternative file names
&Sconstruct;, &sconstruct;, &SConstruct.py;, &Sconstruct.py;
and &sconstruct.py; in that order.
A different file name (which can include a pathname part)
may be specified via the <option>-f</option> option.
Except for the SConstruct file,
these files are not searched for automatically;
you add additional configuration files to the build
by calling the &f-link-SConscript; function.
This allows parts of the build to be conditionally
included or excluded at run-time depending on how &scons; is invoked.
</para>

<para>
Each &SConscript; file in a build configuration is invoked
independently in a separate context.
This provides necessary isolation so that different parts of
the build don't accidentally step on each other.
You have to be explicit about sharing information,
by using the &f-link-Export; function or the &exports; argument
to the &f-link-SConscript; function, as well as the &f-link-Return; function
in a called &SConscript; file, and comsume shared information by using the
&f-link-Import; function.

env = Environment()
</programlisting>

<para>&Consenv; attributes called
<firstterm>&ConsVars;</firstterm> may be set
either by specifying them as keyword arguments when the object is created
or by assigning them a value after the object is created.
These two are nominally equivalent:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env = Environment(FOO='foo')
env['FOO'] = 'foo'
</programlisting>

<!--TODO: how can the user tell which settings are init-only? -->
<para>Note that certain settings which affect tool detection are
referenced only when the tools are initializided,
so you either need either to supply them as part of the call to
&f-link-Environment;, or defer tool initialization.
For example, initializing the Microsoft Visual C++ version you wish to use:
</para>

<programlisting language="python">
# initializes msvc to v14.1
env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION="14.1")

env = Environment()
# msvc tool was initialized to default, does not reinitialize
env['MSVC_VERSION'] = "14.1"

env = Environment(tools=[])
env['MSVC_VERSION'] = "14.1"
# msvc tool initialization was deferred, so will pick up new value
env.Tool('default')
</programlisting>

<para>As a convenience,
&consvars; may also be set or modified by the
<parameter>parse_flags</parameter>
keyword argument during object creation,
which has the effect of the
&f-link-env-MergeFlags;
method being applied to the argument value
after all other processing is completed.
This is useful either if the exact content of the flags is unknown
(for example, read from a control file)
or if the flags need to be distributed to a number of &consvars;.
&f-link-env-ParseFlags; describes how these arguments
are distributed to &consvars;.
</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env = Environment(parse_flags='-Iinclude -DEBUG -lm')
</programlisting>

<para>This example adds 'include' to
the &cv-link-CPPPATH; &consvar;,
'EBUG' to
&cv-link-CPPDEFINES;,
and 'm' to
&cv-link-LIBS;.
</para>

<para>
An existing &consenv; can be duplicated by calling the &f-link-env-Clone;
method. Without arguments, it will be a copy with the same
settings. Otherwise, &f-env-Clone; takes the same arguments as
&f-link-Environment;, and uses the arguments to create a modified copy.
</para>

<para>
&SCons; provides a special &consenv; called the
<firstterm>&DefEnv;</firstterm>.
The &defenv; is used only for global functions, that is,
construction activities called without the context of a regular &consenv;.
See &f-link-DefaultEnvironment; for more information.
</para>

<para>By default, a new &consenv; is
initialized with a set of builder methods
and &consvars; that are appropriate
for the current platform.
The optional <parameter>platform</parameter> keyword argument may be
used to specify that the &consenv; should
be initialized for a different platform:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env = Environment(platform='cygwin')
</programlisting>

<para>Specifying a platform initializes the appropriate
&consvars; in the environment
to use and generate file names with prefixes
and suffixes appropriate for that platform.</para>

<para>Note that the
<literal>win32</literal>
platform adds the
<varname>SystemDrive</varname>
and
<varname>SystemRoot</varname>
variables from the user's external environment
to the &consenv;'s
<varname>ENV</varname>
dictionary.
This is so that any executed commands
that use sockets to connect with other systems
will work on Windows systems.</para>

<para>The <parameter>platform</parameter> argument may be
a string value representing
one of the pre-defined platforms
(<literal>aix</literal>,
<literal>cygwin</literal>,
<literal>darwin</literal>,
<literal>hpux</literal>,
<literal>irix</literal>,
<literal>os2</literal>,
<literal>posix</literal>,
<literal>sunos</literal> or
<literal>win32</literal>),
or it may be be a callable platform object
returned by a call to &f-link-Platform;
selecting a pre-defined platform,
or it may be a user-supplied callable,
in which case the &Environment; method
will call it to update
the new &consenv;:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
def my_platform(env):
    env['VAR'] = 'xyzzy'

env = Environment(platform=my_platform)
</programlisting>

<para>
Note that supplying a non-default platform or custom
fuction for initialization
may bypass settings that should happen for the host system
and should be used with care.
It is most useful in the case where the platform is an alternative for
the one that would be auto-detected,
such as <literal>platform="cygwin"</literal>
on a system which would otherwise
identify as <literal>win32</literal>.
</para>

<para>
The optional <parameter>tools</parameter> and <parameter>toolpath</parameter>
keyword arguments affect the way tools available to the environment are initialized.
See <xref linkend="tools"/> for details.
</para>

<para>
The optional <parameter>variables</parameter> keyword argument
allows passing a Variables object which will be used in the
initialization of the &consenv;
See <xref linkend="commandline_construction_variables"/> for details.

<refsect2 id='tools'>
<title>Tools</title>

<para>
&SCons; has a large number of predefined tool modules
(more properly, <firstterm>tool specification modules</firstterm>)
which are used to help initialize the &consenv;.
An &SCons; tool is only responsible for setup.
For example, if an &SConscript; file declares
the need to construct an object file from
a C-language source file by calling the
&b-link-Object; builder, then a tool representing
an available C compiler needs to have run first,
to set up that builder and all the &consvars;
it needs in the associated &consenv;; the tool itself
is not called in the process of the build. Normally this
happens invisibly as &scons; has per-platform
lists of default tools, and it steps through those tools,
calling the ones which are actually applicable,
skipping those where necessary programs are not
installed on the build system, or other preconditions are not met.
</para>

<para>
A specific set of tools
with which to initialize an environment when
creating it
may be specified using the optional keyword argument
<parameter>tools</parameter>, which takes a list
of tool names.
This is useful to override the defaults,
to specify non-default built-in tools, and
to supply added tools:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env = Environment(tools=['msvc', 'lex'])
</programlisting>

<para>
Tools can also be directly called by using the &f-link-Tool;
method (see below).
</para>

<para>
The <parameter>tools</parameter> argument overrides
the default tool list, it does not add to it, so be
sure to include all the tools you need.
For example if you are  building a c/c++ program
you must specify a tool for at least a compiler and a linker,
as in <literal>tools=['clang', 'link']</literal>.
The tool name <literal>'default'</literal> can
be used to retain the default list.
</para>

<para>If no <parameter>tools</parameter> argument is specified,
or if <parameter>tools</parameter> includes <literal>'default'</literal>,
then &scons; will auto-detect usable tools,
using the execution environment value of <varname>PATH</varname>
(that is, <varname><replaceable>env</replaceable>['ENV']['PATH']</varname> -
the external evironment &PATH; from <varname>os.environ</varname>
is <emphasis>not</emphasis> used)
for looking up any backing programs, and the platform name in effect
to determine the default tools for that platform.
Changing the <varname>PATH</varname>
variable after the &consenv; is constructed will not cause the tools to
be re-detected.</para>

<para>Additional tools can be added, see the
<link linkend='extending_scons'>Extending SCons</link> section
and specifically <link linkend='tool_modules'>Tool Modules</link>.

<title>Builder Methods</title>

<para>You tell &SCons; what to build
by calling <firstterm>Builders</firstterm>,
functions which take particular action(s)
to produce target(s) of a particular type
(conventionally hinted at by the builder name, e.g. &Program;)
from the specified source files.
A builder call is a declaration: &SCons; enters the
specified relationship into its internal dependency node graph,
and only later makes the decision on whether anything is actually built,
since this depends on command-line options,
target selection rules, and whether the target(s) are
out of date with respect to the sources.
</para>

<para>
&SCons;
provides a number of builders, and you can also write your own
(see <link linkend='builder_objects'>Builder Objects</link>).
Builders are created dynamically at run-time,
often (though not always) by tools which determine
whether the external dependencies for the builder are satisfied,
and which perform the necessary setup
(see <link linkend='tools'>Tools</link>).
Builders are attached to a &consenv; as methods.
The available builder methods are registered as
key-value pairs in the
&cv-link-BUILDERS; attribute of the &consenv;,
so the available builders can be examined.
This example displays them for debugging purposes:
</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env = Environment()
print("Builders:", list(env['BUILDERS']))
</programlisting>

<para>
Builder methods take two required arguments:
<parameter>target</parameter>
and
<parameter>source</parameter>.
The <parameter>target</parameter> and
<parameter>source</parameter> arguments
can be specified either as positional arguments,
in which case <parameter>target</parameter> comes first, or as
keyword arguments, using <parameter>target=</parameter>
and <parameter>source=</parameter>.
Although both arguments are nominally required,
if there is a single source and the target can be inferred
the <parameter>target</parameter> argument can be omitted (see below).
Builder methods also take a variety of
keyword arguments, described below.
</para>

<para>Because long lists of file names
can lead to a lot of quoting in a builder call,
&SCons;
supplies a &f-link-Split;
global function
and a same-named environment method
that splits a single string
into a list, using
strings of white-space characters as the delimiter
(similar to the &Python; string <function>split</function>
method, but succeeds even if the input isn't a string).</para>

<para>
The following are equivalent examples of calling the
&Program; builder method:
</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env.Program('bar', ['bar.c', 'foo.c'])
env.Program('bar', Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program('bar', env.Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program(source=['bar.c', 'foo.c'], target='bar')
env.Program(target='bar', source=Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program(target='bar', source=env.Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program('bar', source='bar.c foo.c'.split())
</programlisting>

<para>
Sources and targets can be specified as a scalar or as a list,
composed of either strings or nodes (more on nodes below).
When specifying path strings,
&Python; follows the POSIX pathname convention:
if a string begins with the operating system pathname separator
(on Windows both the slash and backslash separator are accepted,
and any leading drive specifier is ignored for
the determination) it is considered an absolute path,
otherwise it is a relative path.
If the path string contains no separator characters,
it is searched for as a file in the current directory. If it
contains separator characters, the search follows down
from the starting point, which is the top of the directory tree for
an absolute path and the current directory for a relative path.
The "current directory" in this context is the directory
of the &SConscript; file currently being processed.
</para>

<para>
&SCons; also recognizes a third way to specify
path strings: if the string begins with
the <emphasis role="bold">#</emphasis> character it is
<firstterm>top-relative</firstterm> - it works like a relative path but the
search follows down from the directory containing the top-level
&SConstruct; rather than
from the current directory. The <emphasis role="bold">#</emphasis>
can optionally be followed by a pathname separator,
which is ignored if found in that position.
Top-relative paths only work in places where &scons; will
interpret the path (see some examples below).  To be
used in other contexts the string will need to be converted
to a relative or absolute path first.
</para>

<para>Examples:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
# The comments describing the targets that will be built
# assume these calls are in a SConscript file in the
# a subdirectory named "subdir".

# Builds the program "subdir/foo" from "subdir/foo.c":
env.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

# Builds the program "/tmp/bar" from "subdir/bar.c":
env.Program('/tmp/bar', 'bar.c')

# An initial '#' or '#/' are equivalent; the following
# calls build the programs "foo" and "bar" (in the
# top-level SConstruct directory) from "subdir/foo.c" and
# "subdir/bar.c", respectively:
env.Program('#foo', 'foo.c')
env.Program('#/bar', 'bar.c')

# Builds the program "other/foo" (relative to the top-level
# SConstruct directory) from "subdir/foo.c":
env.Program('#other/foo', 'foo.c')

# This will not work, only SCons interfaces understand '#',
# os.path.exists is pure Python:
if os.path.exists('#inc/foo.h'):
    env.Append(CPPPATH='#inc')
</programlisting>

<para>When the target shares the same base name
as the source and only the suffix varies,
and if the builder method has a suffix defined for the target file type,
then the target argument may be omitted completely,
and
&scons;
will deduce the target file name from
the source file name.
The following examples all build the
executable program
<emphasis role="bold">bar</emphasis>
(on POSIX systems)
or
<emphasis role="bold">bar.exe</emphasis>
(on Windows systems)
from the <filename>bar.c</filename> source file:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env.Program(target='bar', source='bar.c')
env.Program('bar', source='bar.c')
env.Program(source='bar.c')
env.Program('bar.c')
</programlisting>

<para>The optional
<parameter>srcdir</parameter>
keyword argument specifies that
all source file strings that are not absolute paths
or top-relative paths
shall be interpreted relative to the specified
<parameter>srcdir</parameter>.
The following example will build the
<filename>build/prog</filename>
(or
<filename>build/prog.exe</filename>
on Windows)
program from the files
<filename>src/f1.c</filename>
and
<filename>src/f2.c</filename>:
</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env.Program('build/prog', ['f1.c', 'f2.c'], srcdir='src')
</programlisting>

<para>The optional
<parameter>parse_flags</parameter>
keyword argument causes behavior similar to the
&f-link-env-MergeFlags; method, where the argument value is
broken into individual settings and merged into the appropriate &consvars;.
</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env.Program('hello', 'hello.c', parse_flags='-Iinclude -DEBUG -lm')
</programlisting>

<para>This example adds 'include' to
the &cv-link-CPPPATH; &consvar;,
'EBUG' to
&cv-link-CPPDEFINES;,
and 'm' to
&cv-link-LIBS;.
</para>

<para>The optional
<parameter>chdir</parameter>
keyword argument
specifies that the Builder's action(s)
should be executed
after changing directory.
If the
<parameter>chdir</parameter>
argument is
a path string or a directory Node,
scons will change to the specified directory.
If the
<parameter>chdir</parameter>
is not a string or Node
and evaluates true,
then &scons; will change to the
target file's directory.</para>

<warning>
<para>
&Python; only keeps one current directory
location even if there are multiple threads.
This means that use of the
<parameter>chdir</parameter>
argument
will
<emphasis>not</emphasis>
work with the SCons
<option>-j</option>
option,
because individual worker threads spawned
by &SCons; interfere with each other
when they start changing directory.</para>
</warning>

<programlisting language="python">
# scons will change to the "sub" subdirectory
# before executing the "cp" command.
env.Command(
    target='sub/dir/foo.out',
    source='sub/dir/foo.in',
    action="cp dir/foo.in dir/foo.out",
    chdir='sub',
)

# Because chdir is not a string, scons will change to the
# target's directory ("sub/dir") before executing the
# "cp" command.
env.Command('sub/dir/foo.out', 'sub/dir/foo.in', "cp foo.in foo.out", chdir=True)
</programlisting>

<para>Note that &SCons; will
<emphasis>not</emphasis>
automatically modify
its expansion of
&consvars; like &cv-link-TARGET;
and &cv-link-SOURCE;
when using the <parameter>chdir</parameter>
keyword argument--that is,
the expanded file names
will still be relative to
the top-level directory where the &SConstruct; was found,
and consequently incorrect
relative to the chdir directory.
If you use the <parameter>chdir</parameter> keyword argument,
you will typically need to supply a different
command line using
expansions like
<literal>${TARGET.file}</literal>
and
<literal>${SOURCE.file}</literal>
to use just the filename portion of the
target and source.</para>

<para>Keyword arguments that are not specifically
recognized are treated as &consvar;
<firstterm>overrides</firstterm>,
which replace or add those variables on a limited basis.
These overrides
will only be in effect when building the target of the builder call,
and will not affect other parts of the build.
For example, if you want to specify
some libraries needed by just one program:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env.Program('hello', 'hello.c', LIBS=['gl', 'glut'])
</programlisting>

<para>or generate a shared library with a non-standard suffix:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env.SharedLibrary(
    target='word',
    source='word.cpp',
    SHLIBSUFFIX='.ocx',
    LIBSUFFIXES=['.ocx'],
)
</programlisting>

<para>Note that both the &cv-link-SHLIBSUFFIX;
and &cv-link-LIBSUFFIXES;
&consvars; must be set if you want &scons; to search automatically
for dependencies on the non-standard library names;
see the descriptions of these variables for more information.</para>

<para>Although the builder methods defined by
&scons;
are, in fact,
methods of a &consenv; object,
many may also be called without an explicit environment:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
Program('hello', 'hello.c')
SharedLibrary('word', 'word.cpp')
</programlisting>

<para>If called this way, the builder will internally use the
&DefEnv; that consists of the tools and values that
&scons;
has determined are appropriate for the local system.</para>

<para>Builder methods that can be called without an explicit
environment (indicated in the listing of builders below
without a leading <varname>env.</varname>)
may be called from custom &Python; modules that you
import into an &SConscript; file by adding the following
to the &Python; module:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
from SCons.Script import *
</programlisting>

<para>
A builder <emphasis>may</emphasis> add additional targets
beyond those requested
if an attached <firstterm>Emitter</firstterm> chooses to do so
(see <xref linkend="builder_objects"/> for more information.
&cv-link-PROGEMITTER; is an example).
For example, the GNU linker takes a command-line argument
<option>-Map=<replaceable>mapfile</replaceable></option>,
which causes it to produce a linker map file in addition
to the executable file actually being linked.
If the &b-link-Program; builder's emitter is configured
to add this mapfile if the option is set,
then two targets will be returned when you only provided for one.
</para>

<para>
For this reason,
builder methods always return a <classname>NodeList</classname>,
a list-like object whose elements are Nodes.
Nodes are the internal representation of build targets or sources
(see <xref linkend="node_objects"/> for more information).
The returned <classname>NodeList</classname> object
can be passed to other builder methods as source(s)
or to other &SCons; functions or methods
where a path string would normally be accepted.
</para>

<para> For example,
to add a specific preprocessor define
when compiling one specific object file
but not the others:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
bar_obj_list = env.StaticObject('bar.c', CPPDEFINES='-DBAR')
env.Program("prog", ['foo.c', bar_obj_list, 'main.c'])
</programlisting>

<para>Using a Node as in this example
makes for a more portable build
by avoiding having to specify
a platform-specific object suffix
when calling the &b-link-Program; builder method.
</para>

<para>The <classname>NodeList</classname> object
is also convenient to pass to the &f-link-Default; function,
for the same reason of avoiding a platform-specific name:
</para>

<programlisting language="python">
tgt = env.Program("prog", ["foo.c", "bar.c", "main.c"])
Default(tgt)
</programlisting>

<para>Builder calls will automatically "flatten"
lists passed as source and target, so they are free to
contain elements which are themselves lists, such as
<varname>bar_obj_list</varname>
returned by the &b-link-StaticObject; call.
If you need to manipulate a list of lists returned by builders
directly in &Python; code,
you can either build a new list by hand:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
foo = Object('foo.c')
bar = Object('bar.c')
objects = ['begin.o'] + foo + ['middle.o'] + bar + ['end.o']
for obj in objects:
    print(str(obj))
</programlisting>

<para>Or you can use the &f-link-Flatten;
function supplied by &SCons;
to create a list containing just the Nodes,
which may be more convenient:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
foo = Object('foo.c')
bar = Object('bar.c')
objects = Flatten(['begin.o', foo, 'middle.o', bar, 'end.o'])
for obj in objects:
    print(str(obj))
</programlisting>

<para>Since builder calls return
a list-like object, not an actual &Python; list,
it is not appropriate to use the &Python; add
operator (<literal>+</literal> or <literal>+=</literal>)
to append builder results to a &Python; list.
Because the list and the object are different types,
&Python; will not update the original list in place,
but will instead create a new <classname>NodeList</classname> object
containing the concatenation of the list
elements and the builder results.
This will cause problems for any other &Python; variables
in your SCons configuration
that still hold on to a reference to the original list.
Instead, use the &Python; list
<function>extend</function>
method to make sure the list is updated in-place.
Example:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
object_files = []

# Do NOT use += here:
#    object_files += Object('bar.c')
#
# It will not update the object_files list in place.
#
# Instead, use the list extend method:
object_files.extend(Object('bar.c'))
</programlisting>

<para>The path name for a Node's file may be used
by passing the Node to &Python;'s builtin
<function>str</function>
function:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
bar_obj_list = env.StaticObject('bar.c', CPPDEFINES='-DBAR')
print("The path to bar_obj is:", str(bar_obj_list[0]))
</programlisting>

<para>Note that because the Builder call returns a
<classname>NodeList</classname>,
you have to access the first element in the list
(<literal>bar_obj_list[0]</literal> in the example)
to get at the Node that actually represents
the object file.</para>

<para>
When trying to handle errors that may occur in a builder method,
consider that the corresponding Action is executed at a different
time than the &SConscript; file statement calling the builder.
It is not useful to wrap a builder call in a
<systemitem>try</systemitem> block,
since success in the builder call is not the same as
the builder itself succeeding.
If necessary, a Builder's Action should be coded to exit with
a useful exception message indicating the problem in the &SConscript; files -
programmatically recovering from build errors is rarely useful.
</para>

<para>
The following builder methods are predefined in the
&SCons; core software distribution.
Depending on the setup of a particular
&consenv; and on the type and software
installation status of the underlying system,
not all builders may be available in that
&consenv;.
Since the function calling signature is the same for all builders:
</para>
<programlisting language="python">
<function>Buildername</function>(<parameter>target, source, [key=val, ...]</parameter>)
</programlisting>
<para>
it is omitted in this listing for brevity.

targets of builder methods automatically depend on their sources.
An explicit dependency can
be specified using the
&f-link-env-Depends;

<para>In addition,
&scons;
automatically scans
source files for various programming languages,

C source files,

SCons also has default support
for scanning D source files,

to add support for additional source file types.
These can be added to the default
Scanner object used by the

<title>Methods and Functions To Do Things</title>

<para>In addition to Builder methods,
&scons;
provides a number of other &consenv; methods
and global functions to
manipulate the build configuration.</para>

<para>Usually, a &consenv; method
and global function with the same name both exist
for convenience.
In the following list, the global function
is documented in this style:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
<function>Function</function>(<parameter>arguments, [optional arguments]</parameter>)
</programlisting>

<para>and the &consenv; method looks like:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
<replaceable>env</replaceable>.<methodname>Function</methodname>(<parameter>arguments, [optional arguments]</parameter>)
</programlisting>

<para>If the function can be called both ways,
then both forms are listed.</para>

<para>The global function and same-named
&consenv; method
provide almost identical functionality, with a couple of exceptions.
First, many of the &consenv; methods affect only that
&consenv;, while the global function has a
global effect. Second, where appropriate,
calling the functionality through a &consenv; will
substitute &consvars; into
any supplied string arguments, while the global function doesn't have the
context of a &consenv; to pick variables from,
so it cannot perform the substitution.
For example:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
Default('$FOO')

env = Environment(FOO='foo')
env.Default('$FOO')
</programlisting>

<para>In the above example,
the call to the global &f-Default;
function will add a target named
<emphasis role="bold">$FOO</emphasis>
to the list of default targets,
while the call to the
&f-env-Default; &consenv; method
will expand the value
and add a target named
<emphasis role="bold">foo</emphasis>
to the list of default targets.
For more on &consvar; expansion,
see the next section on
&consvars;.</para>

<para>Global functions may be called from custom Python modules that you
import into an &SConscript; file by adding the following import
to the Python module:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
from SCons.Script import *
</programlisting>

<title>SConscript Variables</title>

<para>In addition to the global functions and methods,
&scons;
supports a number of variables
that can be used in &SConscript; files
to affect how you want the build to be performed.</para>

<variablelist>
  <varlistentry id="v-ARGLIST">
  <term>&ARGLIST;</term>
  <listitem>
<para>A list of the
<emphasis>keyword</emphasis>=<emphasis>value</emphasis>
arguments specified on the command line.
Each element in the list is a tuple
containing the argument.
The separate
<emphasis>keyword</emphasis>
and
<emphasis>value</emphasis>
elements of the tuple
can be accessed by
subscripting for elements
<emphasis role="bold">[0]</emphasis>
and
<emphasis role="bold">[1]</emphasis>
of the tuple, or, more readably, by using tuple unpacking.
Example:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
print("first keyword, value =", ARGLIST[0][0], ARGLIST[0][1])
print("second keyword, value =", ARGLIST[1][0], ARGLIST[1][1])
key, value = ARGLIST[2]
print("third keyword, value =", key, value)
for key, value in ARGLIST:
    # process key and value
</programlisting>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry id="v-ARGUMENTS">
  <term>&ARGUMENTS;</term>
  <listitem>
<para>A dictionary of all the
<emphasis>keyword</emphasis>=<emphasis>value</emphasis>
arguments specified on the command line.
The dictionary is not in order,
and if a given keyword has
more than one value assigned to it
on the command line,
the last (right-most) value is
the one in the &ARGUMENTS;
dictionary.</para>

<para>Example:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
if ARGUMENTS.get('debug', 0):
    env = Environment(CCFLAGS='-g')
else:
    env = Environment()
</programlisting>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry id="v-BUILD_TARGETS">
  <term>&BUILD_TARGETS;</term>
  <listitem>
<para>A list of the targets which
&scons;
has been asked to build.
The contents will be either those targets listed
on the command line, or, if none, those targets set
via calls to the &f-link-Default; function.
It does
<emphasis>not</emphasis>
contain any dependent targets that &scons;
selects for building as a result of making the sure the
specified targets are up to date, if those targets
did not appear on the command line.
The list is empty if neither
command line targets or &Default; calls are present.
</para>
<para>
The elements of this list may be strings
<emphasis>or</emphasis>
nodes, so you should run the list through the Python
<function>str</function>
function to make sure any Node path names
are converted to strings.</para>

<para>Because this list may be taken from the
list of targets specified using the
&Default; function,
the contents of the list may change
on each successive call to &Default;.
See the
&DEFAULT_TARGETS; list, below,
for additional information.</para>

<para>Example:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
if 'foo' in BUILD_TARGETS:
    print("Don't forget to test the `foo' program!")
if 'special/program' in BUILD_TARGETS:
    SConscript('special')
</programlisting>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry id="v-COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS">
  <term>&COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS;</term>
  <listitem>
<para>A list of the targets explicitly specified on
the command line. If there are command line targets,
this list will have the same contents as &BUILD_TARGETS;.
If there are no targets specified on the command line,
the list is empty. The elements of this list are strings.
This can be used, for example,
to take specific actions only
when certain targets are explicitly being built.</para>

<para>Example:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
if 'foo' in COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS:
    print("Don't forget to test the `foo' program!")
if 'special/program' in COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS:
    SConscript('special')
</programlisting>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry id="v-DEFAULT_TARGETS">
  <term>&DEFAULT_TARGETS;</term>
  <listitem>
<para>A list of the target
<emphasis>nodes</emphasis>
that have been specified using the
&f-link-Default;
function. If there are no command line
targets, this list will have the same contents as
&BUILD_TARGETS;.
Since the elements of the list are nodes,
you need to call the Python
<function>str</function>
function on them to get the path name for each Node.</para>

<para>Example:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
print(str(DEFAULT_TARGETS[0]))
if 'foo' in [str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS]:
    print("Don't forget to test the `foo' program!")
</programlisting>

<para>The contents of the
&DEFAULT_TARGETS;
list change on on each successive call to the
&Default; function:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
print([str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])   # originally []
Default('foo')
print([str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])   # now a node ['foo']
Default('bar')
print([str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])   # now a node ['foo', 'bar']
Default(None)
print([str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])   # back to []
</programlisting>

<para>Consequently, be sure to use
&DEFAULT_TARGETS;
only after you've made all of your
&Default;() calls,
or else simply be careful of the order
of these statements in your &SConscript; files
so that you don't look for a specific
default target before it's actually been added to the list.</para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>
These variables may be accessed from custom Python modules that you
import into an &SConscript; file by adding the following
to the Python module:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
from SCons.Script import *
</programlisting>

<para>A &consenv; has an associated dictionary of
<firstterm>&consvars;</firstterm>
that are used by built-in or user-supplied build rules.
&Consvar; naming must follow the same rules as
Python identifier naming:
the initial character must be an underscore or letter,
followed by any number of underscores, letters, or digits.
A &consenv; is not a Python dictionary itself,
but it can be indexed like one to access a
&consvar;:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env["CC"] = "cc"
flags = env.get("CPPDEFINES", [])
</programlisting>

<para>&Consvars; can also be retrieved and set
by using the &f-link-Dictionary;
method of the &consenv; to create an actual
dictionary:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
cvars = env.Dictionary()
cvars["CC"] = "cc"
</programlisting>

<para>&Consvars; can also be passed to the &consenv;
constructor:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env = Environment(CC="cc")
</programlisting>

<para>or when copying a &consenv; using the
&f-link-Clone; method:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env2 = env.Clone(CC="cl.exe")
</programlisting>

<para>
&Consvars; can also be supplied as keyword
arguments to a builder, in which case those settings
affect only the work done by that builder call,
and not the &consenv; as a whole.
This concept is called an <firstterm>override</firstterm>:
</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env.Program('hello', 'hello.c', LIBS=['gl', 'glut'])
</programlisting>

<para>A number of useful &consvars; are automatically defined by
scons for each supported platform, and you can modify these
or define any additional &consvars; for your own use,
taking care not to overwrite ones which &SCons; is using.
The following is a list of the possible
automatically defined &consvars;.
</para>

<para>Note the actual list available
at execution time will never include all of these, as the ones
detected as not being useful (wrong platform, necessary
external command or files not installed, etc.) will not be set up.
Correct build setups should be resilient to the possible
absence of certain &consvars; before using them,
for example by using a &Python; dictionary
<function>get</function> method to retrieve the value and
taking alternative action if the return indicates the variable is unset.
The &f-link-env-Dump; method can be called to examine the
&consvars; set in a particular environment.

<refsect2 id='configure_contexts'>
<title>Configure Contexts</title>

<para>&SCons;
supports a
<firstterm>&configure_context;</firstterm>,
an integrated mechanism similar to the
various <constant>AC_CHECK</constant> macros in GNU &Autoconf;
for testing the existence of external items needed
for the build, such as C header files, libraries, etc.
The mechanism is portable across platforms.
</para>

<para>
&scons;
does not maintain an explicit cache of the tested values
(this is different than &Autoconf;),
but uses its normal dependency tracking to keep the checked values
up to date. However, users may override this behaviour with the
<link linkend="opt-config"><option>--config</option></link>
command line option.</para>

<variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
  <term><function>Configure</function>(<parameter>env, [custom_tests, conf_dir, log_file, config_h, clean, help]</parameter>)</term>
  <term><replaceable>env</replaceable>.<methodname>Configure</methodname>(<parameter>[custom_tests, conf_dir, log_file, config_h, clean, help]</parameter>)</term>
  <listitem>
<para>Create a &configure_context;, which tracks information
discovered while running tests. The context includes a local &consenv;
(available as <replaceable>context</replaceable>.<varname>env</varname>)
which is used when running the tests and
which can be updated with the check results.
Only one context may be active
at a time, but a new context can be created
after the active one is completed.
For the global function form, the required <parameter>env</parameter>
describes the initial values for the context's local &consenv;;
for the &consenv; method form the instance provides the values.
</para>
<para>
<emphasis>Changed in version 4.0</emphasis>: raises an exception
on an attempt to create a new context when there is an active context.
</para>
<para><parameter>custom_tests</parameter>
specifies a dictionary containing custom tests
(see the section on custom tests below).
The default value is <constant>None</constant>,
meaning no custom tests are added to the &configure_context;.</para>
<para>
<parameter>conf_dir</parameter>
specifies a directory where the test cases are built.
This directory is not used for building normal targets.
The default value is
<quote><filename>#/.sconf_temp</filename></quote>.</para>
<para>
<parameter>log_file</parameter>
specifies a file which collects the output from commands
that are executed to check for the existence of header files, libraries, etc.
The default is <quote><filename>#/config.log</filename></quote>.
If you are using variant directories,
you may want to place the log file for a given build
under that build's variant directory.</para>
<para>
<parameter>config_h</parameter>
specifies a C header file where the results of tests
will be written. The results will consist of lines like
<literal>#define HAVE_STDIO_H</literal>,
<literal>#define HAVE_LIBM</literal>, etc.
Customarily, the name chosen is <quote><filename>config.h</filename></quote>.
The default is to not write a
<parameter>config_h</parameter>
file.
You can specify the same
<parameter>config_h</parameter>
file in multiple calls to &Configure;,
in which case &SCons;
will concatenate all results in the specified file.
Note that &SCons;
uses its normal dependency checking
to decide if it's necessary to rebuild
the specified
<parameter>config_h</parameter>
file.
This means that the file is not necessarily re-built each
time scons is run,
but is only rebuilt if its contents will have changed
and some target that depends on the
<parameter>config_h</parameter>
file is being built.</para>
<para>The <parameter>clean</parameter>
and
<parameter>help</parameter>
arguments can be used to suppress execution of the configuration
tests when the
<option>-c</option>/<option>--clean</option>
or
<option>-H</option>/<option>-h</option>/<option>--help</option>
options are used, respectively.
The default behavior is always to execute
&configure_context; tests,
since the results of the tests may
affect the list of targets to be cleaned
or the help text.
If the configure tests do not affect these,
then you may add the
<option>clean=False</option>
or
<option>help=False</option>
arguments
(or both)
to avoid unnecessary test execution.</para>
  </listitem>

  <varlistentry>
  <term><replaceable>context</replaceable>.<methodname>Finish</methodname>()</term>
  <listitem>
<para>This method must be called after configuration is done.
Though required, this is not enforced except
if &Configure; is called again while there is still an active context,
in which case an exception is raised.
&Finish; returns the environment as modified
during the course of running the configuration checks.
After this method is called, no further checks can be performed
with this configuration context.
However, you can create a new
&configure_context; to perform additional checks.

<para>You can define your own custom checks
in addition to using the predefined checks.
To enable custom checks,
pass a dictionary to the &f-link-Configure; function
as the <parameter>custom_tests</parameter> parameter.
The dictionary maps the names of the checks
to the custom check callables
(either a Python function or an instance of a class implementing a
<methodname>__call__</methodname> method).
Each custom check will be called with a
a <classname>CheckContext</classname>
instance  as the first parameter followed by the remaining arguments,
which must be supplied by the user of the check.
A <classname>CheckContext</classname> is not the same as
a configure context; rather it is an instance of a class

<title>Command-Line Construction Variables</title>

<para>Often when building software,
some variables need to be specified at build time.
For example, libraries needed for the build may be in non-standard
locations, or site-specific compiler options may need to be passed to the
compiler.
&SCons;
provides a <firstterm>&Variables;</firstterm>
object to support overriding &consvars; with values obtained
from various sources, often from the command line:</para>

<screen>
<userinput>scons VARIABLE=foo</userinput>
</screen>

<para>The variable values can also be specified in a configuration file
or an &SConscript; file.</para>

<para>To obtain the object for manipulating values,
call the &Variables; function:</para>

<variablelist>
  <varlistentry id="v-Variables">
  <term><function>Variables</function>([<parameter>files, [args]]</parameter>)</term>
  <listitem>
<para>If <parameter>files</parameter> is a file or
list of files, they are executed as Python scripts,
and the values of (global) Python variables set in
those files are added as &consvars; in the &DefEnv;.
If no files are specified,
or the
<parameter>files</parameter>
argument is
<constant>None</constant>,
then no files will be read
(supplying <constant>None</constant> is necessary
if there are no files but you want to specify
<parameter>args</parameter> as a positional argument).
</para>

<para>
The following example file
contents could be used to set an alternative C compiler:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
CC = 'my_cc'
</programlisting>

<para>If
<parameter>args</parameter>
is specified, it is a dictionary of
values that will override anything read from
<parameter>files</parameter>.
The primary use is to pass the
&ARGUMENTS; dictionary that holds variables
specified on the command line,
allowing you to indicate that if a setting appears
on both the command line and in the file(s),
the command line setting takes precedence.
However, any dictionary can be passed.
Examples:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars = Variables('overrides.py', ARGUMENTS)
vars = Variables(None, {FOO:'expansion', BAR:7})
</programlisting>

<para>
Calling &Variables; with no arguments is equivalent to:
</para>
<programlisting language="python">
vars = Variables(files=None, args=ARGUMENTS)
</programlisting>

<para>
Note that since the variables are eventually added as &consvars;,
you should choose variable names which do not unintentionally change
pre-defined &consvars; that your project will make use of
(see <xref linkend="construction_variables"/>).
</para>

  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>

<para>Variables objects have the following methods:</para>

  <variablelist>
  <varlistentry id="v-Add">
  <term><replaceable>vars</replaceable>.<function>Add</function>(<parameter>key, [help, default, validator, converter]</parameter>)</term>
  <listitem>
<para>Add a customizable &consvar; to the Variables object.
<parameter>key</parameter>
is either the name of the variable,
or a tuple (or list), in which case
the first item in the tuple is taken as the variable name,
and any remaining values are considered aliases for the variable.
<parameter>help</parameter>
is the help text for the variable
(default empty string).
<parameter>default</parameter>
is the default value of the variable
(default <constant>None</constant>).
If <parameter>default</parameter> is
<constant>None</constant>
and a value is not specified,
the &consvar; will not
be added to the &consenv;.
</para>
<para>
As a special case, if <parameter>key</parameter>
is a tuple (or list) and is the <emphasis>only</emphasis>
argument, the tuple is unpacked into the five parameters
listed above left to right, with any missing members filled with
the respecitive default values. This form allows <function>Add</function>

<link linkend='v-ListVariable'><function>ListVariable</function></link>,
<link linkend='v-PackageVariable'><function>PackageVariable</function></link>
and
<link linkend='v-PathVariable'><function>PathVariable</function></link>.
</para>
<para>
If the optional <parameter>validator</parameter> is supplied,
it is called to validate the value of the variable.
A function supplied as a validator must accept
three arguments: <parameter>key</parameter>,
<parameter>value</parameter> and <parameter>env</parameter>,
and should raise an exception with a helpful error message
if <parameter>value</parameter> is invalid.
No return value is expected from the validator.
</para>
<para>
If the optional <parameter>converter</parameter> is supplied,
it is called to convert the value before putting it in the environment,
and should take either a value
or a value and environment as parameters.
The converter function must return a value,
which will be converted into a string and be passed to the
<parameter>validator</parameter> (if any)
and then added to the &consenv;.</para>

<para>Examples:</para>

<programlisting language="python">

<title>Node Objects</title>

<para>
&SCons; represents objects that are the sources or targets of
build operations as <firstterm>Nodes</firstterm>,
which are internal data structures.
There are a number of user-visible types of nodes:
File Nodes, Directory Nodes, Value Nodes and Alias Nodes.
Some of the node types have public attributes and methods,
described below. Each of the node types has a global function
and a matching environment method to create instances:
&f-link-File;, &f-link-Dir;, &f-link-Value; and &f-link-Alias;.
</para>

<refsect3 id='file_and_directory_nodes'>
<title>Filesystem Nodes</title>

<para>
The &f-link-File; and &f-link-Dir;
functions/methods return
File and Directory Nodes, respectively.
File and Directory Nodes
(collectively, Filesystem Nodes)
represent build components that correspond to an entry
in the computer's filesystem,
whether or not such an entry exists at the time the Node is created.
You do not usually need to explicitly create filesystem Nodes,
since when you supply a string as a target or source of a Builder,
&SCons; will create the Nodes as needed to populate the
dependency graph.
Builders return the target Node(s) in the form of a list,
which you can then make use of.
However, since filesystem Nodes have some useful
public attributes and methods
that you can use in &SConscript; files,
it is sometimes appropriate to create them manually,
outside the regular context of a Builder call.
</para>
<para>
The following attributes provide information about a Node:
</para>

<variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
  <term><replaceable>node</replaceable>.<varname>path</varname></term>
  <listitem>

<para>
Filesystem Node objects have methods to create new
File and Directory Nodes relative to the original Node.
There are also times when you may need to refer to an entry
in a filesystem without knowing in advance whether it's a
file or a directory.
For those situations,
there is an <function>Entry</function> method of filesystem node objects,
which returns a Node that can represent either a file or a directory.
</para>

these methods will place the new Node within the directory

<refsect3 id='value_and_alias_nodes'>
<title>Value and Alias Nodes</title>

<para>
&SCons; provides two other Node types to represent
object that will not have an equivalent filesystem entry.
Such Nodes always need to be created explicitly.
</para>

<para>
The &f-link-Alias; method returns an Alias Node.
Aliases are virtual objects - they will not themselves result
in physical objects being constructed, but are entered into
the dependency graph related to their sources.
An alias is checked for up to date by checking if
its sources are up to date.
An alias is built by making sure its sources have been built,
and if any building took place,
applying any Actions that are defined as part of the alias.
</para>

<para>
An &f-link-Alias; call creates an entry in the alias namespace,
which is used for disambiguation.
If an alias source has a string valued name,
it will be resolved to a filesystem entry Node,
unless it is found in the alias namespace,
in which case it it resolved to the matching alias Node.
As a result, the order of &f-Alias; calls is significant.
An alias can refer to another alias, but only if the
other alias has previously been created.
</para>

<para>
The &f-link-Value; method returns a Value Node.
Value nodes are often used for generated data that
will not have any corresponding filesystem entry,
but will be used to determine whether a build target is out of date,
or to include as part of a build Action.
Common examples are timestamp strings,
revision control version strings
and other run-time generated strings.
</para>

<para>
A Value Node can also be the target of a builder.

<refsect1 id='extending_scons'>
<title>EXTENDING SCONS</title>

<para>
&SCons; is designed to be extensible through provided facilities,
so changing the code of &SCons; itself is only rarely needed
to customize its behavior.
A number of the main operations use callable objects
which can be supplemented by writing your own.
Builders, Scanners and Tools each use a kind of plugin system,
allowing you to easily drop in new ones.
Information about creating
<link linkend='builder_objects'>Builder Objects</link> and
<link linkend='scanner_objects'>Scanner Objects</link>
appear in the following sections.
The instructions &SCons; actually uses to
construct things are called Actions,
and it is easy to create Action Objects and hand them
to the objects that need to know about those actions
(besides Builders, see &f-link-AddPostAction;,
&f-link-AddPreAction; and &f-link-Alias; for some examples
of other places that take Actions).
<link linkend='action_objects'>Action Objects</link>
are also described below.
Adding new Tool modules is described in

<refsect2 id='builder_objects'>
<title>Builder Objects</title>

<para>&scons;
can be extended to build different types of targets
by adding new Builder objects
to a &consenv;.
<emphasis>In general</emphasis>,
you should only need to add a new Builder object
when you want to build a new type of file or other external target.
For output file types &scons; already knows about,
you can usually modify the behavior of premade Builders
such as &b-link-Program;, &b-link-Object; or &b-link-Library;
by changing the &consvars; they use
(&cv-link-CC;, &cv-link-LINK;, etc.).
In this manner you can, for example, change the compiler to use,
which is simpler and less error-prone than writing a new builder.
The documentation for each Builder lists which
&consvars; it uses.
</para>

<para>Builder objects are created
using the
&f-link-Builder;
factory function.
Once created, a builder is added to an environment
by entering it in the &cv-link-BUILDERS; dictionary
in that environment (some of the examples
in this section illustrate this).
Doing so automatically triggers &SCons; to add a method
with the name of the builder to the environment.

This may more efficient when multiple

This is necessary whenever you want a target to be rebuilt

If the value of <parameter>chdir</parameter>

&SCons; will change to the specified directory.
Otherwise, if <parameter>chdir</parameter> evaluates true,

  <varlistentry>
  <term><parameter>batch_key</parameter></term>
  <listitem>
<para>
If provided, indicates that the Action can create multiple target files
by processing multiple independent source files simultaneously.
(The canonical example is "batch compilation"
of multiple object files
by passing multiple source files
to a single invocation of a compiler
such as Microsoft's Visual C / C++ compiler.)
If the
<parameter>batch_key</parameter>
argument evaluates True and is not a callable object,
the configured Action object will cause
&scons;
to collect all targets built with the Action object
and configured with the same &consenv;
into single invocations of the Action object's
command line or function.
Command lines will typically want to use the
&cv-CHANGED_SOURCES; &consvar;
(and possibly &cv-CHANGED_TARGETS; as well)
to only pass to the command line those sources that
have actually changed since their targets were built.
Example:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
a = Action('build $CHANGED_SOURCES', batch_key=True)
</programlisting>

<para>The
<parameter>batch_key</parameter>
argument may also be
a callable function
that returns a key that
will be used to identify different
"batches" of target files to be collected
for batch building.
A
<parameter>batch_key</parameter>
function must accept four parameters:
<parameter>action</parameter>,
<parameter>env</parameter>,
<parameter>target</parameter> and
<parameter>source</parameter>.
The first parameter, <parameter>action</parameter>,
is the active action object.
The second parameter, <parameter>env</parameter>,
is the &consenv; configured for the target.
The <parameter>target</parameter> and <parameter>source</parameter>
parameters are the lists of targets and sources
for the configured action.
</para>

<para>The returned key should typically
be a tuple of values derived from the arguments,
using any appropriate logic to decide
how multiple invocations should be batched.
For example, a
<parameter>batch_key</parameter>
function may decide to return
the value of a specific &consvar;
from <parameter>env</parameter>
which will cause
&scons;
to batch-build targets
with matching values of that &consvar;,
or perhaps return the
Python <function>id</function>()
of the entire &consenv;,
in which case
&scons;
will batch-build
all targets configured with the same &consenv;.
Returning
<constant>None</constant>
indicates that
the particular target should
<emphasis>not</emphasis>
be part of any batched build,
but instead will be built
by a separate invocation of action's
command or function.
Example:</para>

<title>Variable Substitution</title>

<para>
Before executing a command, &scons;
performs parameter expansion (<firstterm>substitution</firstterm>)
on the string that makes up the action part of the builder.
The format of a substitutable parameter is
<literal>${<replaceable>expression</replaceable>}</literal>.
If <replaceable>expression</replaceable> refers to a variable,
the braces in <literal>${<replaceable>expression</replaceable>}</literal>
can be omitted <emphasis>unless</emphasis> the variable name is
immediately followed by a character that could either be interpreted
as part of the name, or is &Python; syntax such as
<emphasis role="bold">[</emphasis> (for indexing/slicing)
or <emphasis role="bold">.</emphasis> (for attribute access -
see <link linkend="special_attributes">Special Attributes</link> below).
</para>

<para>
If <replaceable>expression</replaceable> refers to a &consvar;,
it is replaced with the value of that variable in the
&consenv; at the time of execution.
If <replaceable>expression</replaceable> looks like
a variable name but is not defined in the &consenv;
it is replaced with an empty string.
If <replaceable>expression</replaceable> refers to one of the
<link linkend="special_variables">Special Variables</link>
(see below) the corresponding value of the variable is substituted.
<replaceable>expression</replaceable> may also be
a &Python; expression to be evaluated.
See <link linkend='python_code_substitution'>Python Code Substitution</link>
below for a description.
</para>

<para>&SCons; uses the following rules when converting &consvars; into
command line strings:</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
  <para>If the value is a string it is interpreted as space delimited
  command line arguments.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
  <para>If the value is a list it is interpreted as a list of command
  line arguments. Each element of the list is converted to a string.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
  <para>Anything that is not a list or string is converted to a string and
  interpreted as a single command line argument.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
  <para>Newline characters (<literal>\n</literal>) delimit lines.
  The newline parsing is done after
  all other parsing, so it is not possible for arguments (e.g. file names) to
  contain embedded newline characters.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
  <para>For a literal <emphasis role="bold">$</emphasis>
  use <emphasis role="bold">$$</emphasis>.
  For example, <literal>$$FOO</literal> will be left in the
  final string as <literal>$FOO</literal>.</para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
When a build action is executed, a hash of the command line is
saved, together with other information about the target(s) built
by the action, for future use in rebuild determination.
This is called the <firstterm>&buildsig;</firstterm>
(or <firstterm>&build_action; signature</firstterm>).
The escape sequence
<emphasis role="bold">$(</emphasis>
<replaceable>subexpression</replaceable>
<emphasis role="bold">$)</emphasis>
may be used to indicate parts of a command line
that may change without
causing a rebuild--that is,
which are not to be included when calculating the &buildsig;.
All text from
<emphasis role="bold">$(</emphasis>
up to and including the matching
<emphasis role="bold">$)</emphasis>
will be removed from the command line
before it is added to the &buildsig;
while only the
<emphasis role="bold">$(</emphasis>
and
<emphasis role="bold">$)</emphasis>
will be removed before the command is executed.
For example, the command line string:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
"echo Last build occurred $( $TODAY $). &gt; $TARGET"
</programlisting>

<para>would execute the command:</para>

<screen>
echo Last build occurred $TODAY. &gt; $TARGET
</screen>

<para>but the &buildsig; added to any target files would be computed from:</para>

<screen>
echo Last build occurred  . &gt; $TARGET
</screen>

<para>While &consvars; are normally directly substituted,
if a &consvar; has a value which
is a callable &Python; object
(a function, or a class with a <literal>__call__</literal> method),
that object is called during substitution.
The callable must accept four arguments:
<parameter>target</parameter>,
<parameter>source</parameter>,
<parameter>env</parameter> and
<parameter>for_signature</parameter>.
<parameter>source</parameter> is a list of source nodes,
<parameter>target</parameter> is a list of target nodes,
<parameter>env</parameter> is the &consenv; to use for context,
and <parameter>for_signature</parameter> is
a boolean value that tells the callable
if it is being called for the purpose of generating a &buildsig;.
Since the &buildsig; is used for rebuild determination,
variable elements that do not affect whether
a rebuild should be triggered
should be omitted from the returned string
if <parameter>for_signature</parameter> is true.
See <emphasis role="bold">$(</emphasis>
and <emphasis role="bold">$)</emphasis> above
for the syntax.
</para>

<para>
&SCons; will insert whatever
the callable returns
into the expanded string:
</para>

<programlisting language="python">
def foo(target, source, env, for_signature):
    return "bar"

# Will expand $BAR to "bar baz"
env = Environment(FOO=foo, BAR="$FOO baz")
</programlisting>

<para>As a reminder, substitution happens when
<literal>$BAR</literal> is actually used in a
builder action.  The value of <literal>env['BAR']</literal>
will be exactly as it was set: <literal>"$FOO baz"</literal>.
This can make debugging tricky,
as the substituted result is not available at the time
the &SConscript; files are being interpreted and
thus not available to the <systemitem>print</systemitem> function.
However, you can perform the substitution on demand
by calling the &f-link-env-subst; method for this purpose.
</para>

<para>You can use this feature to pass arguments to a
callable variable by creating a callable class
that stores passed arguments in the instance,
and then uses them
(in the <methodname>__call__</methodname> method)
when the instance is called.
Note that in this case,
the entire variable expansion must
be enclosed by curly braces
so that the arguments will
be associated with the
instantiation of the class:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
class foo:
    def __init__(self, arg):
        self.arg = arg

    def __call__(self, target, source, env, for_signature):
        return self.arg + " bar"

# Will expand $BAR to "my argument bar baz"
env=Environment(FOO=foo, BAR="${FOO('my argument')} baz")
</programlisting>

<refsect3 id='python_code_substitution'>
<title>Python Code Substitution</title>

<para>
If a substitutable expression using the notation
<literal>${<replaceable>expression</replaceable>}</literal>
does not appear to match one of the other substitution patterns,
it is evaluated as a Python expression.
This uses Python's <function>eval</function> function,
with the <parameter>globals</parameter> parameter set to
the current environment's set of &consvars;,
and the result substituted in.
So in the following case:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env.Command(
    'foo.out', 'foo.in', "echo ${COND==1 and 'FOO' or 'BAR'} &gt; $TARGET"
)
</programlisting>

<para>the command executed will be either</para>

<screen>
echo FOO &gt; foo.out
</screen>

<para>or</para>

<screen>
echo BAR &gt; foo.out
</screen>

<para>according to the current value of <literal>env['COND']</literal>
when the command is executed.
The evaluation takes place when the target is being
built, not when the &SConscript; is being read.  So if
<literal>env['COND']</literal> is changed
later in the &SConscript;, the final value will be used.</para>

<para>Here's a more complete example.  Note that all of
<envar>COND</envar>,
<envar>FOO</envar>,
and
<envar>BAR</envar> are &consvars;,
and their values are substituted into the final command.
<envar>FOO</envar> is a list, so its elements are interpolated
separated by spaces.</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env=Environment()
env['COND'] = 1
env['FOO'] = ['foo1', 'foo2']
env['BAR'] = 'barbar'
env.Command(
    'foo.out', 'foo.in', "echo ${COND==1 and FOO or BAR} &gt; $TARGET"
)
</programlisting>

<para>will execute:</para>
<screen>
echo foo1 foo2 &gt; foo.out
</screen>

<para>
In point of fact, Python expression evaluation is
how the special attributes are substituted:
they are simply attributes of the Python objects
that represent &cv-TARGET;, &cv-SOURCES;, etc.,
which &SCons; passes to <function>eval</function> which
returns the value.
</para>

<caution><para>
Use of the Python <function>eval</function> function
is considered to have security implications, since,
depending on input sources,
arbitrary unchecked strings of code can be executed by the Python interpreter.
Although &SCons; makes use of it in a somewhat restricted context,
you should be aware of this issue when using the
<literal>${python-expression-for-subst}</literal> form.

<refsect2 id='scanner_objects'>
<title>Scanner Objects</title>

<para>
Scanner objects are used
to scan specific file types for implicit dependencies,
for example embedded preprocessor/compiler directives
that cause other files to be included during processing.
&SCons; has a number of pre-built Scanner objects,
so it is usually only necessary to set up Scanners for new file types.
You do this by calling the &f-link-Scanner; factory function.
&f-Scanner; accepts the following arguments.
Only <parameter>function</parameter> is required;
the rest are optional:
</para>

<variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
  <term><parameter>function</parameter></term>
  <listitem>
<para>
A scanner function to call to process
a given Node (usually a file)
and return a list of Nodes
representing the implicit
dependencies (usually files) found in the contents.
The function must accept three required arguments,
<parameter>node</parameter>,
<parameter>env</parameter> and
<parameter>path</parameter>,
and an optional fourth,
<parameter>arg</parameter>.
<parameter>node</parameter> is
the internal &SCons; node representing the file to scan,
<parameter>env</parameter> is the &consenv; to use during
the scan, and <parameter>path</parameter> is a tuple
of directories that can be searched for files,
as generated by the optional scanner
<parameter>path_function</parameter> (see below).
If <parameter>argument</parameter> was supplied when the Scanner
object was created, it is given as <parameter>arg</parameter>
when the scanner function is called; since <parameter>argument</parameter>
is optional, the default is no <parameter>arg</parameter>.
</para>
<para>
The function can use use
<function>str</function>(<parameter>node</parameter>)
to fetch the name of the file,
<replaceable>node</replaceable>.<function>dir</function>
to fetch the directory the file is in,
<replaceable>node</replaceable>.<function>get_contents</function>()
to fetch the contents of the file as bytes or
<replaceable>node</replaceable>.<function>get_text_contents</function>()
to fetch the contents of the file as text.
</para>
<para>
The function must take into account the <parameter>path</parameter>
directories when generating the dependency Nodes. To illustrate this,
a C language source file may contain a line like
<literal>#include "foo.h"</literal>.  However, there is no guarantee
that <filename>foo.h</filename> exists in the current directory:
the contents of &cv-link-CPPPATH; is passed to the C preprocessor which
will look in those places for the header,
so the scanner function needs to look in those places as well
in order to build Nodes with correct paths.
Using &f-link-FindPathDirs; with an argument of <literal>CPPPATH</literal>
as the <parameter>path_function</parameter> in the &f-Scanner; call
means the scanner function will be called with the paths extracted
from &cv-CPPPATH; in the environment <parameter>env</parameter>
passed as the <parameter>paths</parameter> parameter.
</para>
<para>
Note that the file to scan is
<emphasis>not</emphasis>
guaranteed to exist at the time the scanner is called -
it could be a generated file which has not been generated yet -
so the scanner function must be tolerant of that.
</para>
<para>
Alternatively, you can supply a dictionary as the
<parameter>function</parameter> parameter,
to map keys (such as file suffixes) to other Scanner objects.
A Scanner created this way serves as a dispatcher:
the Scanner's <parameter>skeys</parameter> parameter is
automatically populated with the dictionary's keys,
indicating that the Scanner handles Nodes which would be
selected by those keys; the mapping is then used to pass
the file on to a different Scanner that would not have been
selected to handle that Node based on its
own <parameter>skeys</parameter>.

A value that evaluates true enables recursion;
<emphasis>recursive</emphasis>

<para>
Once created, a Scanner can added to an environment
by setting it in the &cv-link-SCANNERS; list,
which automatically triggers &SCons; to also add it
to the environment as a method.
However, usually a scanner is not truly standalone, but needs to
be plugged in to the existing selection mechanism for
deciding how to scan source files based on filename extensions.
For this, &SCons; has a global
<classname>SourceFileScanner</classname>
object that is used by
the &b-link-Object;, &b-link-SharedObject; and &b-link-StaticObject;
builders to decide
which scanner should be used.
You can use the
<methodname>SourceFileScanner.add_scanner()</methodname>
method to add your own Scanner object
to the
&SCons;
infrastructure
that builds target programs or
libraries from a list of
source files of different types:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
def xyz_scan(node, env, path):
    contents = node.get_text_contents()
    # Scan the contents and return the included files.

XYZScanner = Scanner(xyz_scan)

SourceFileScanner.add_scanner('.xyz', XYZScanner)

env.Program('my_prog', ['file1.c', 'file2.f', 'file3.xyz'])

<title>Tool Modules</title>

<para>
Additional tools can be added to a project either by
placing them in a <filename>site_tools</filename> subdirectory
of a site directory, or in a custom location specified to
&scons; by giving the
<parameter>toolpath</parameter> keyword argument to &f-link-Environment;.
A tool module is a form of Python module, invoked internally
using the Python import mechanism, so a tool can consist either
of a single source file taking the name of the tool
(e.g. <filename>mytool.py</filename>) or a directory taking
the name of the tool (e.g. <filename>mytool/</filename>)
which contains at least an <filename>__init__.py</filename> file.
</para>

<para>
The <parameter>toolpath</parameter> parameter
takes a list as its value:
</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env = Environment(tools=['default', 'foo'], toolpath=['tools'])
</programlisting>

<para>
This looks for a tool specification module (<filename>mytool.py</filename>,
or directory <filename>mytool</filename>)
in directory <filename>tools</filename> and in the standard locations,
as well as using the ordinary default tools for the platform.
</para>

<para>
Directories specified via <parameter>toolpath</parameter> are prepended
to the existing tool path.
The default tool path is any <filename>site_tools</filename> directories,
so tools in a specified <parameter>toolpath</parameter> take priority,
followed by tools in a <filename>site_tools</filename> directory,
followed by built-in tools.  For example, adding
a tool specification module <filename>gcc.py</filename> to the toolpath
directory would override the built-in &t-link-gcc; tool.
The tool path is stored in the environment and will be
used by subsequent calls to the &f-link-Tool; method,
as well as by &f-link-env-Clone;.
</para>

<programlisting language="python">
base = Environment(toolpath=['custom_path'])
derived = base.Clone(tools=['custom_tool'])
derived.CustomBuilder()
</programlisting>

<para>
A tool specification module must include two functions:
</para>

<variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
    <term><function>generate</function>(<parameter>env, **kwargs</parameter>)</term>
    <listitem>
<para>Modify the &consenv; <parameter>env</parameter>
to set up necessary &consvars;, Builders, Emitters, etc.,
so the facilities represented by the tool can be executed.
Care should be taken not to overwrite &consvars; intended
to be settable by the user. For example:
</para>
<programlisting language="python">
def generate(env):
    ...
    if 'MYTOOL' not in env:
        env['MYTOOL'] = env.Detect("mytool")
    if 'MYTOOLFLAGS' not in env:
        env['MYTOOLFLAGS'] = SCons.Util.CLVar('--myarg')
    ...
</programlisting>

<para>The <function>generate</function> function
may use any keyword arguments
that the user supplies via <parameter>kwargs</parameter>
to vary its initialization.</para>
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
    <term><function>exists</function>(<parameter>env</parameter>)</term>
    <listitem>
<para>Return a true value if the tool can
be called in the context of <parameter>env</parameter>.
else false.
Usually this means looking up one or more
known programs using the <varname>PATH</varname> from the
supplied <parameter>env</parameter>, but the tool can
make the <emphasis>exists</emphasis> decision in any way it chooses.
</para>
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<note>
<para>
At the moment, user-added tools do not automatically have their
<function>exists</function> function called.
As a result, it is recommended that the <function>generate</function>
function be defensively coded - that is, do not rely on any
necessary existence checks already having been performed.
This is expected to be a temporary limitation,
and the <function>exists</function> function should still be provided.
</para>
</note>

<para>The elements of the <parameter>tools</parameter> list may also
be functions or callable objects,
in which case the &Environment; method
will call those objects
to update the new &consenv; (see &f-link-Tool; for more details):</para>

<programlisting language="python">
def my_tool(env):
    env['XYZZY'] = 'xyzzy'

env = Environment(tools=[my_tool])
</programlisting>

<para>The individual elements of the <parameter>tools</parameter> list
may also themselves be lists or tuples of the form
<literal>(toolname, kw_dict)</literal>.
SCons searches for the
<parameter>toolname</parameter>
specification file as described above, and
passes
<parameter>kw_dict</parameter>,
which must be a dictionary, as keyword arguments to the tool's
<function>generate</function>
function.
The
<function>generate</function>
function can use the arguments to modify the tool's behavior
by setting up the environment in different ways
or otherwise changing its initialization.</para>

<programlisting language="python">
# in tools/my_tool.py:
def generate(env, **kwargs):
  # Sets MY_TOOL to the value of keyword 'arg1' '1' if not supplied
  env['MY_TOOL'] = kwargs.get('arg1', '1')

def exists(env):
  return True

# in SConstruct:
env = Environment(tools=['default', ('my_tool', {'arg1': 'abc'})],
                  toolpath=['tools'])
</programlisting>

<para>The tool specification (<function>my_tool</function> in the example)
can use the
&cv-link-PLATFORM; variable from
the &consenv; it is passed to customize the tool for different platforms.
</para>

<para>Tools can be "nested" - that is, they
can be located within a subdirectory in the toolpath.
A nested tool name uses a dot to represent a directory separator</para>

<programlisting language="python">

env.SomeTool(targets, sources)

<refsect2 id='f_file_suffix'>
<title>Fortran File Suffixes</title>

<para>
There are several ways source file suffixes impact the
behavior of &SCons; when working with Fortran language code
(not all are system-specific, but they are included here
for completeness).
</para>

<para>
As the Fortran language has evolved through multiple
standards editions, projects might have a need to handle
files from different language generations differently.
To this end, &SCons; dispatches to  a different compiler
dialect setup (expressed as a set of &consvars;)
depending on the file suffix.
By default, all of these setups start out the same,
but individual &consvars; can be modified as needed to tune a given dialect.
Each of these dialacts has a tool specification module
whose documentation describes the &consvars; associated
with that dialect: <filename>.f</filename>
(as well as <filename>.for</filename> and <filename>.ftn</filename>)
in &t-link-fortran;; (&consvars; start with <literal>FORTRAN</literal>)
<filename>.f77</filename> in &t-link-f77;;
(&consvars; start with <literal>F77</literal>)
<filename>.f90</filename> in &t-link-f90;;
(&consvars; start with <literal>F90</literal>)
<filename>.f95</filename> in &t-link-f95;;
(&consvars; start with <literal>F95</literal>)
<filename>.f03</filename> in &t-link-f03;;
(&consvars; start with <literal>F03</literal>)
<filename>.f08</filename> in &t-link-f08;
(&consvars; start with <literal>F08</literal>).
</para>

<para>
While &SCons; recognizes multiple internal dialects
based on filename suffixes,
the convention of various available Fortran compilers is
to assign an actual meaning to only two of these suffixes:
<filename>.f</filename>
(as well as <filename>.for</filename> and <filename>.ftn</filename>)
refers to the fixed-format source
code that was the only available option in FORTRAN 77 and earlier,
and <filename>.f90</filename> refers to free-format source code
which became available as of the Fortran 90 standard.
Some compilers recognize suffixes which correspond to Fortran
specifications later then F90 as equivalent to
<filename>.f90</filename> for this purpose,
while some do not - check the documentation for your compiler.
An occasionally suggested policy suggestion is to use only
<filename>.f</filename> and <filename>.f90</filename>
as Fortran filename suffixes.
The fixed/free form determination can usually be controlled
explicitly with compiler flags
(e.g. <option>-ffixed-form</option> for gfortran),
overriding any assumption that may be made based on the source file suffix.
</para>

<para>
The source file suffix does not imply conformance
with the similarly-named Fortran standard - a suffix of
<filename>.f08</filename> does not mean you are compiling
specifically for Fortran 2008.  Normally, compilers
provide command-line options for making this selection
(e.g. <option>-std=f2008</option> for gfortran).
</para>

<para>
For dialects from F90 on (including the generic FORTRAN dialect),
a suffix of <filename>.mod</filename> is recognized for Fortran modules.
These files are a side effect of compiling a Fortran
source file containing module declarations,
and must be available when other code which declares
that it uses the module is processed.
&SCons; does not currently have integrated support for submodules,
introduced in the Fortran 2008 standard -
the invoked compiler will produce results,
but &SCons; will not recognize
<filename>.smod</filename> files as tracked objects.
</para>

<para>
On a case-sensitive system such as Linux or UNIX,
a file with a an upper-cased suffix from the set
<filename>.F</filename>,
<filename>.FOR</filename>,
<filename>.FTN</filename>,
<filename>.F90</filename>,
<filename>.F95</filename>,
<filename>.F03</filename> and
<filename>.F08</filename>
is treated as a Fortran source file
which shall first be run through
the standard C preprocessor.
The lower-cased versions of these suffixes do not
trigger this behavior.
On systems which do not distinguish between uppper
and lower case in filenames,
this behavior is not available,
but files suffixed with either
<filename>.FPP</filename>
or <filename>.fpp</filename>
are always passed to the preprocessor first.
This matches the convention of <command>gfortran</command>
from the GNU Compiler Collection,
and also followed by certain other Fortran compilers.
For these two suffixes,
the generic <emphasis>FORTRAN</emphasis> dialect will be selected.
</para>

<para>
&SCons; itself does not invoke the preprocessor,
that is handled by the compiler,
but it adds &consvars; which are applicable to the preprocessor run.
You can see this difference by examining
&cv-link-FORTRANPPCOM; and &cv-link-FORTRANPPCOMSTR;
which are used instead of
&cv-link-FORTRANCOM; and &cv-link-FORTRANCOMSTR; for that dialect.

<refsect2 id='windows_cygwin_tools_and_cygwin_python_v'>
<title>Windows: Cygwin Tools and Cygwin Python vs. Windows Pythons</title>

<para>Cygwin supplies a set of tools and utilities
that let users work on a
Windows system using a POSIX-like environment.
The Cygwin tools, including Cygwin &Python;,
do this, in part,
by sharing an ability to interpret POSIX-style path names.
For example, the Cygwin tools
will internally translate a Cygwin path name
like <filename>/cygdrive/c/mydir</filename>
to an equivalent Windows pathname
of <filename>C:/mydir</filename> (equivalent to <filename>C:\mydir</filename>).
</para>

<para>Versions of &Python;
that are built for native Windows execution,
such as the python.org and ActiveState versions,
do not understand the Cygwin path name semantics.
This means that using a native Windows version of &Python;
to build compiled programs using Cygwin tools
(such as &gcc;, &bison; and &flex;)
may yield unpredictable results.
"Mixing and matching" in this way
can be made to work,
but it requires careful attention to the use of path names
in your &SConscript; files.</para>

<para>In practice, users can sidestep
the issue by adopting the following guidelines:
When using Cygwin's &gcc; for compiling,
use the Cygwin-supplied &Python; interpreter
to run &scons;;
when using Microsoft Visual C/C++
(or some other "native" Windows compiler)
use the python.org, Microsoft Store, ActiveState or other
native version of &Python; to run &scons;.
</para>

<para>
This discussion largely applies to the msys2 environment
as well (with the use of the mingw compiler toolchain),
in particular the recommendation to use the msys2 version of
&Python; if running &scons; from inside an msys2 shell.
</para>

<refsect2 id='windows_sconsbat_file'>
<title>Windows: <filename>scons.bat</filename> file</title>

<para>On Windows, if &scons; is executed via a wrapper
<filename>scons.bat</filename> batch file,
there are (at least) two ramifications.
Note this is no longer the default - &scons; installed
via &Python;''s <command>pip</command> installer
will have an <command>scons.exe</command> which does
not have these limitations:
</para>

<para>First, Windows command-line users
that want to use variable assignment
on the command line
may have to put double quotes
around the assignments, otherwise the
Windows command shell will consume those as
arguments to itself, not to &scons;:</para>

<screen>
<userinput>scons "FOO=BAR" "BAZ=BLEH"</userinput>
</screen>

<para>Second, the Cygwin shell does not
recognize typing <userinput>scons</userinput>
at the command line prompt as referring to this wrapper.
You can work around this either by executing
<userinput>scons.bat</userinput>
(including the extension)
from the Cygwin command line,
or by creating a wrapper shell
script named
<filename>scons</filename> which
invokes <filename>scons.bat</filename>.

Python; interpreter, &scons; will prefer the MinGW tools over the Cygwin
tools, if they are both installed, regardless of the order of the bin
directories in the <envar>PATH</envar> variable.
If you have both MSVC and MinGW
installed and you want to use MinGW instead of MSVC,
then you must explicitly tell &scons; to use MinGW by passing
<code>tools=['mingw']</code>
to the &Environment; function, because &scons; will prefer the MSVC tools

<para>The following example shows adding an extremely simple scanner
(<function>kfile_scan</function>)
that doesn't use a search path at all
and simply returns the
file names present on any
<literal>include</literal>
lines in the scanned file.
This would implicitly assume that all included

</programlisting>

<para>It is important to note that you

you can use the &f-link-env-File;
function of your current &consenv; in order to create nodes on the fly from
a sequence of file names with relative paths.</para>

<para>Here is a similar but more complete example that adds
a scanner which searches
a path of directories
(specified as the
<envar>MYPATH</envar> &consvar;)
for files that actually exist:</para>

<programlisting language="python">

env = Environment(SCANNERS=scanners, MYPATH=['incs'])

env.Command('foo', 'foo.x', 'xprocess &lt; $SOURCES &gt; $TARGET')
</programlisting>

<para>The
&f-link-FindPathDirs;
function used in the previous example returns a function
(actually a callable Python object)
that will return a list of directories

&consvar;. It lets &scons; detect the file
<filename>incs/foo.inc</filename>,
even if
<filename>foo.x</filename>
contains the line

only.
If you need to customize how the search path is derived,

as follows:</para>

<title>Using Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled headers</title>

<para>Since <filename>windows.h</filename> includes everything
and the kitchen sink, it can take quite
some time to compile it over and over again for a bunch of object files, so
Microsoft provides a mechanism to compile a set of headers once and then
include the previously compiled headers in any object file. This
technology is called precompiled headers (<firstterm>PCH</firstterm>).
The general recipe is to create a
file named <filename>StdAfx.cpp</filename>
that includes a single header named <filename>StdAfx.h</filename>,
and then include every header you want to precompile in
<filename>StdAfx.h</filename>,
and finally include <filename>"StdAfx.h</filename>
as the first header in all the source files you are
compiling to object files. For example:</para>

<para><filename>StdAfx.h</filename>:</para>

<programlisting language="C++">
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;my_big_header.h&gt;
</programlisting>

<para><filename>StdAfx.cpp</filename>:</para>

<programlisting language="C++">
#include &lt;StdAfx.h&gt;
</programlisting>

<para><filename>Foo.cpp</filename>:</para>

<programlisting language="C++">
#include &lt;StdAfx.h&gt;

/* do some stuff */
</programlisting>

<para><filename>Bar.cpp</filename>:</para>

<programlisting language="C++">
#include &lt;StdAfx.h&gt;

/* do some other stuff */
</programlisting>

<para><filename>SConstruct</filename>:</para>

<programlisting language="python">
env=Environment()
env['PCHSTOP'] = 'StdAfx.h'
env['PCH'] = env.PCH('StdAfx.cpp')[0]
env.Program('MyApp', ['Foo.cpp', 'Bar.cpp'])
</programlisting>

<para>For more information see the documentation for the &b-link-PCH; builder,
and the &cv-link-PCH; and &cv-link-PCHSTOP; &consvars;.

<title>Using Microsoft Visual C++ external debugging information</title>

<para>Since including debugging information in programs and shared libraries can

&scons; supports PDB files through the &cv-PDB; &consvar;.</para>

<title>ENVIRONMENT</title>

<para>In general, &scons; is not controlled by environment
variables set in the shell used to invoke it, leaving it
up to the &SConscript; file author to import those if desired.
However the following variables are imported by
&scons; itself if set:
</para>

<variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
    <term><envar>SCONS_LIB_DIR</envar></term>
    <listitem>
<para>Specifies the directory that contains the &scons;
Python module directory. Normally &scons; can deduce this,
but in some circumstances, such as working with a source
release, it may be necessary to specify
(for example,
<filename>/home/aroach/scons-src-0.01/src/engine</filename>).</para>
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry id="v-SCONSFLAGS">
    <term><envar>SCONSFLAGS</envar></term>
    <listitem>
<para>A string containing options that will be used by &scons;
in addition to those passed on the command line.
Can be used to reduce frequent retyping of common options.
The contents of <envar>SCONSFLAGS</envar> are considered
before any passed command line options,
so the command line can be used to override
<envar>SCONSFLAGS</envar> options if necessary.
</para>
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
    <term><envar>SCONS_CACHE_MSVC_CONFIG</envar></term>
    <listitem>
<para>(Windows only). If set, save the shell environment variables
generated when setting up the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler
(and/or Build Tools) to a cache file, to give these settings
persistence across &scons; invocations.
Generating this information is relatively expensive,
so using this option may aid performance where &scons; is run often,
such as Continuous Integration setups.</para>

<para>If set to a True-like value (<literal>"1"</literal>,
<literal>"true"</literal> or
<literal>"True"</literal>) will cache to a file named
<filename>scons_msvc_cache.json</filename> in the user's home directory.
If set to a pathname, will use that pathname for the cache.</para>

<para>Note: this implementation may still be somewhat fragile.
In case of problems, remove the cache file - recreating with
fresh info normally resolves any issues.
&SCons; ignores failures reading or writing the cache file
and will silently revert to non-cached behavior in such cases.
</para>

<para><emphasis>New in 3.1 (experimental).
The default cache file name was changed to
its present value in 4.4, and contents were expanded.</emphasis>
</para>
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
    <term><envar>QTDIR</envar></term>
    <listitem>
<para>If using the &t-link-qt; tool, this is the path to
the Qt installation to build against. &SCons; respects this
setting because it is a long-standing convention in the Qt world,
where multiple Qt installations are possible.</para>
