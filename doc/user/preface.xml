  <para>

  Thank you for taking the time to read about &SCons;.
  &SCons; is a modern
  software construction too - a software utility
  for building software (or other files)
  and keeping built software up-to-date
  whenever the underlying input files change.

  </para>

  <para>

  The most distinctive thing about &SCons;
  is that its configuration files are
  actually <emphasis>scripts</emphasis>,
  written in the &Python; programming language.
  This is in contrast to most alternative build tools,
  which typically invent a new language to
  configure the build.
  &SCons; still has a learning curve, of course,
  because you have to know what functions to call
  to set up your build properly,
  but the underlying syntax used should be familiar
  to anyone who has ever looked at a Python script.

  </para>

  <para>

  Paradoxically,
  using Python as the configuration file format
  makes &SCons;
  <emphasis>easier</emphasis>
  for non-programmers to learn
  than the cryptic languages of other build tools,
  which are usually invented by programmers for other programmers.
  This is in no small part due to the
  consistency and readability that are hallmarks of Python.
  It just so happens that making a real, live
  scripting language the basis for the
  configuration files
  makes it a snap for more accomplished programmers
  to do more complicated things with builds,
  as necessary.

  </para>

  <section>
  <title>Why &SCons;?</title>

    <para>

    &SCons; is a response to a perennial problem:
    building software is harder than it should be.
    In a nutshell:  the old, reliable model of the
    venerable and ubiquitous &Make; program
    has had a hard time keeping up with
    how complicated building software has become.
    The fact that &Make; has kept up as well as it has is impressive,
    and a testament to how the simplicity.
    But anyone who has wrestled with &Automake; and &Autoconf;
    to try to guarantee that a bit of software
    will build correctly on multiple platforms
    can tell you that it takes a lot of work to get right.

    </para>

  <section>
  <title>&SCons; Principles</title>

    <para>

    There are a few overriding principles the &SCons; team
    tries to follow in the design and implementation.

    </para>

    <variablelist>

      <varlistentry>
      <term>Correctness</term>

      <listitem>
      <para>

      First and foremost,
      by default, &SCons; guarantees a correct build
      even if it means sacrificing performance a little.
      We strive to guarantee the build is correct
      regardless of how the software being built is structured,
      how it may have been written,
      or how unusual the tools are that build it.

      </para>
      </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
      <term>Performance</term>

      <listitem>
      <para>

      Given that the build is correct,
      we try to make &SCons; build software
      as quickly as possible.
      In particular, wherever we may have needed to slow
      down the default &SCons; behavior to guarantee a correct build,
      we also try to make it easy to speed up &SCons;
      through optimization options that let you trade off
      guaranteed correctness in all end cases for
      a speedier build in the usual cases.

      </para>
      </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
      <term>Convenience</term>

      <listitem>
      <para>

      &SCons; tries to do as much for you out of the box as reasonable,
      including detecting the right tools on your system
      and using them correctly to build the software.

      </para>
      </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

    </variablelist>

    <para>

    In a nutshell, we try hard to make &SCons; just
    "do the right thing" and build software correctly,
    with a minimum of hassles.

  <title>How to Use this Guide</title>

    <para>

    This guide intends to coach you how to use &SCons; effectively
    and efficiently, by providing a range of examples and usage scenarios.
    As such it is not exactly a tutorial (as usually those build
    a single example topic from start to finish), but if you are
    just starting with &SCons; it <emphasis>is</emphasis> recommended
    you step through the first 10 chapters
    in sequence as this will give a solid
    grounding in the principles of working with &SCons;.
    If you follow that trail, you can feel free to initially skip
    sections on extending &SCons;, such as
    <emphasis>Writing your own Decider Function</emphasis>,
    and come back to those if the need arises.

    </para>

    <para>

    The remaining chapters cover more advanced topics that not all
    build systems will need, and can be used in more of a single-topic
    way, to read if you find you need that particular information.

    </para>

    <para>

    It is often useful to keep &SCons; man page open in a separate
    browser tab or window to refer to as a complement to this Guide,
    as the User Guide does not attempt to provide every detail.
    While this Guide's Appendices A-D do duplicate information that appears
    in the man page (this is to allow intra-document links to
    definitions of &consvars;, builders, tools and environment methods
    to work), the rest of the man page is unique content.

    </para>

  <section>
  <title>A Caveat About This Guide's Completeness</title>

  <para>

  &SCons; is a volunteer-run open source project.
  As such, the &SCons; documentation isn't always
  completely up-to-date with all the available features -
  somehow it's almost harder to write high quality, easy to
  use documentation than it is to implement a feature in software.
  In other words, there may be  a lot that &SCons; can do that
  isn't yet covered in this User's Guide.

  </para>

  <para>

  Although this User's Guide may not be as complete as it could be,
  the development process does emphasize
  making sure that the &SCons; man page is kept up-to-date
  with new features.
  So if you're trying to figure out how to do something
  that &SCons; supports
  but can't find enough (or any) information here,
  it would be worth your while to look
  at the man page to see if the information is covered there.
  And if you do,
  maybe you'd even consider contributing
  a section to the User's Guide
  so the next person looking for
  that information won't have to
  go through the same thing...?

  </para>

  </section>

  <section>
  <title>Acknowledgements</title>

    <para>

    &SCons; would not exist without a lot of help
    from a lot of people,
    many of whom may not even be aware
    that they helped or served as inspiration.
    So in no particular order,
    and at the risk of leaving out someone:

    </para>

    <para>

    First and foremost,
    &SCons; owes a tremendous debt to Bob Sidebotham,
    the original author of the classic Perl-based &Cons; tool
    which Bob first released to the world back around 1996.
    Bob's work on Cons classic provided the underlying architecture
    and model of specifying a build configuration
    using a real scripting language.
    My real-world experience working on Cons
    informed many of the design decisions in SCons,
    including the improved parallel build support,
    making Builder objects easily definable by users,
    and separating the build engine from the wrapping interface.

    </para>

    <para>

    Greg Wilson was instrumental in getting
    &SCons; started as a real project
    when he initiated the Software Carpentry design
    competition in February 2000.
    Without that nudge,
    marrying the advantages of the Cons classic
    architecture with the readability of Python
    might have just stayed no more than a nice idea.

    </para>

    <para>

    The entire &SCons; team have been
    absolutely wonderful to work with,
    and &SCons; would be nowhere near as useful a
    tool without the energy, enthusiasm
    and time people have contributed over the past few years.
    The "core team"
    of Chad Austin, Anthony Roach,
    Bill Deegan, Charles Crain, Steve Leblanc, Greg Noel,
    Gary Oberbrunner, Greg Spencer and Christoph Wiedemann
    have been great about reviewing my (and other) changes
    and catching problems before they get in the code base.
    Of particular technical note:
    Anthony's outstanding and innovative work on the tasking engine
    has given &SCons; a vastly superior parallel build model;
    Charles has been the master of the crucial Node infrastructure;
    Christoph's work on the Configure infrastructure
    has added crucial Autoconf-like functionality;
    and Greg has provided excellent support
    for Microsoft Visual Studio.

    </para>

    <para>

    Special thanks to David Snopek for contributing
    his underlying "Autoscons" code that formed
    the basis of Christoph's work with the Configure functionality.
    David was extremely generous in making
    this code available to &SCons;,
    given that he initially released it under the GPL
    and &SCons; is released under a less-restrictive MIT-style license.

    </para>

    <!--

    <para>

    &SCons; has received contributions
    from many other people, of course:
    Matt Balvin (extending long command-line support on Windows),
    Allen Bierbaum (extensions and fixes to Options),
    Steve Christensen (help text sorting and function action signature fixes),
    Michael Cook (avoiding losing signal bits from executed commands),
    Derrick 'dman' Hudson (),
    Alex Jacques (work on the Windows scons.bat file),
    Stephen Kennedy (performance enhancements),
    Lachlan O'Dea (SharedObject() support for masm
    and normalized paths for the WhereIs() function),
    Damyan Pepper (keeping output like Make),
    Jeff Petkau (significant fixes for CacheDir and other areas),
    Stefan Reichor (Ghostscript support),
    Zed Shaw (Append() and Replace() environment methods),
    Terrel Shumway (build and test fixes, as well as the SCons Wiki)
    and

    Thanks to Peter Miller
    for his splendid change management system, &Aegis;,
    which has provided the &SCons; project
    with a robust development methodology from day one,
    and which showed me how you could
    integrate incremental regression tests into
    a practical development cycle
    (years before eXtreme Programming arrived on the scene).

    </para>

    <para>

    And last, thanks to Guido van Rossum
    for his elegant scripting language,
    which is the basis not only for the &SCons; implementation,
    but for the interface itself.
