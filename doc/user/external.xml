  <para>

  Sometimes a project needs to interact with other projects
  in various ways.  For example, many open source projects
  make use of components from other open source projects,
  and want to use those in their released form, not recode
  their builds into &SCons;.  As another example, sometimes
  the flexibility and power of &SCons; is useful for managing the
  overall project, but developers might like faster incremental
  builds when making small changes by using a different tool.

  </para>

  <para>

  This chapter shows some techniques for interacting with other
  projects and tools effectively from within &SCons;.

    <title>Creating a Compilation Database</title>

    <para>

    Tooling to perform analysis and modification
    of source code often needs to know not only the source code
    itself, but also how it will be compiled, as the compilation line
    affects the behavior of macros, includes, etc. &SCons; has a
    record of this information once it has run, in the form of
    Actions associated with the sources, and can emit this information
    so tools can use it.

    </para>

    <para>

    The Clang project has defined a <firstterm>JSON Compilation Database</firstterm>.
    This database is in common use as input into Clang tools
    and many IDEs and editors as well.
    See
    <ulink url="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html">
      <citetitle>JSON Compilation Database Format Specification</citetitle>
    </ulink>
    for complete information. &SCons; can emit a 
    compilation database in this format
    by enabling the &t-link-compilation_db; tool
    and calling the &b-link-CompilationDatabase; builder
    (<emphasis>available since &scons; 4.0</emphasis>).

    </para>

    <para>

    The compilation database can be populated with
    source and output files either with paths relative
    to the top of the build, or using absolute paths.
    This is controlled by
    <envar>COMPILATIONDB_USE_ABSPATH=(True|False)</envar>
    which defaults to <constant>False</constant>.
    The entries in this file can be filtered by using

    <envar>COMPILATIONDB_PATH_FILTER='pattern'</envar>
    where the filter pattern is a string following the Python
    <ulink url="https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html">
      <systemitem>fnmatch</systemitem>
    </ulink>
    syntax.
    This filtering can be used for outputting different
    build variants to different compilation database files.

    </para>

    <para>

    The following example illustrates generating a compilation
    database containing absolute paths:

    </para>

    <scons_example name="external_cdb_ex1">
      <file name="SConstruct" printme="1">
env = Environment(COMPILATIONDB_USE_ABSPATH=True)
env.Tool('compilation_db')
env.CompilationDatabase()
env.Program('hello.c')
      </file>
      <file name="hello.c">
int main( int argc, char* argv[] )
{
  return 0;
}
      </file>
    </scons_example>

    <scons_output example="external_cdb_ex1" suffix="1">
      <scons_output_command>scons -Q</scons_output_command>
    </scons_output>

    <para><filename>compile_commands.json</filename> contains:</para>

    <programlisting language="json">
[
    {
        "command": "gcc -o hello.o -c hello.c",
        "directory": "/home/user/sandbox",
        "file": "/home/user/sandbox/hello.c",
        "output": "/home/user/sandbox/hello.o"
    }
]
    </programlisting>

    <para>

    Notice that the generated database contains only an entry for
    the <filename>hello.c/hello.o</filename> pairing,
    and nothing for the generation of the final executable
    <filename>hello</filename> - the transformation of
    <filename>hello.o</filename> to <filename>hello</filename>
    does not have any information that affects interpretation
    of the source code,
    so it is not interesting to the compilation database.

    </para>

    <para>

    Although it can be a little surprising at first glance,
    a compilation database target is, like any other target,
    subject to &scons; target selection rules.
    This means if you set a default target (that does not
    include the compilation database), or use command-line
    targets, it might not be selected for building.
    This can actually be an advantage, since you don't
    necessarily want to regenerate the compilation database
    every build.
    The following example
    shows selecting relative paths (the default)
    for output and source,
    and also giving a non-default name to the database.
    In order to be able to generate the database separately from building,
    an alias is set referring to the database,
    which can then be used as a target - here we are only
    building the compilation database target, not the code.

    </para>

    <scons_example name="external_cdb_ex2">
      <file name="SConstruct" printme="1">
env = Environment()
env.Tool('compilation_db')
cdb = env.CompilationDatabase('compile_database.json')
Alias('cdb', cdb)
env.Program('test_main.c')
      </file>
      <file name="test_main.c">
#include "test_main.h"
int main( int argc, char* argv[] )
{
  return 0;
}
      </file>
      <file name="test_main.h">
/* dummy include file */
      </file>
    </scons_example>

    <scons_output example="external_cdb_ex2" suffix="1">
      <scons_output_command>scons -Q cdb</scons_output_command>
    </scons_output>

    <para><filename>compile_database.json</filename> contains:</para>

    <programlisting language="json">
[
    {
        "command": "gcc -o test_main.o -c test_main.c",
        "directory": "/home/user/sandbox",
        "file": "test_main.c",
        "output": "test_main.o"
    }
]
    </programlisting>

    <para>

    The following (incomplete) example shows using filtering
    to separate build variants.
    In the case of using variants,
    you want different compilation databases for each,
    since the build parameters differ, so the code analysis
    needs to see the correct build lines for the 32-bit build
    and 64-bit build hinted at here.
    For simplicity of presentation,
    the example omits the setup details of the variant directories:

    </para>

    <sconstruct>
env = Environment()
env.Tool('compilation_db')

env1 = env.Clone()
env1['COMPILATIONDB_PATH_FILTER'] = 'build/linux32/*'
env1.CompilationDatabase('compile_commands-linux32.json')

env2 = env.Clone()
env2['COMPILATIONDB_PATH_FILTER'] = 'build/linux64/*'
env2.CompilationDatabase('compile_commands-linux64.json')
    </sconstruct>

    <para><filename>compile_commands-linux32.json</filename> contains:</para>

    <programlisting language="json">
[
    {
        "command": "gcc -m32 -o build/linux32/test_main.o -c test_main.c",
        "directory": "/home/user/sandbox",
        "file": "test_main.c",
        "output": "build/linux32/test_main.o"
    }
]
    </programlisting>

    <para><filename>compile_commands-linux64.json</filename> contains:</para>

    <programlisting language="json">
[
    {
        "command": "gcc -m64 -o build/linux64/test_main.o -c test_main.c",
        "directory": "/home/user/sandbox",
        "file": "test_main.c",
        "output": "build/linux64/test_main.o"
    }
]
    </programlisting>
