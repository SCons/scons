  <para>

  It's often useful to keep any built files completely
  separate from the source files. Consider if you have a
  project to build software for a variety of different
  controller hardware.  The boards are able to share a
  lot of code, so it makes sense to keep them in the same
  source tree, but certain build options in the source code
  and header files differ.  If you build "Controller A" first,
  then "Controller B", on the second build everything would
  have to be rebuilt, because &SCons; sees that the build
  instructions differ, and thus the targets that depend on those
  different instructions are not valid for the current build.
  Now when you go back and build for "Controller A",
  things have to be rebuilt from scratch again for the same reason.
  However, if you can separate the places the output files
  go, this problem can be avoided.
  You can even set up to do both builds in one invocation of &SCons;.

  </para>

  <para>

  You can enable this separation by creating one or more
  <firstterm>variant directory</firstterm> trees
  that are used to hold the built objects files, libraries,
  and executable programs, etc.
  for a specific flavor, or variant, of build.
  &SCons; provides two ways to do this,
  one through the &f-link-SConscript; function that we've already seen,
  and the second through a more flexible &f-link-VariantDir; function.

  </para>

  <para>

  Historical note:  the &VariantDir; function
  used to be called &BuildDir;, a name which was
  removed because the &SCons; functionality
  differs from a familiar model of a "build directory"
  implemented by other build systems like GNU Autotools.
  You might still find references to the old name on
  the Internet in postings about &SCons;, but it no longer works.

  </para>

  <section>
  <title>Specifying a Variant Directory Tree as Part of an &SConscript; Call</title>

    <para>

    The most straightforward way to establish a variant directory tree
    relies the fact that the usual way to
    set up a build hierarchy is to have an
    SConscript file in the source subdirectory.
    If you pass a &variant_dir; argument to the
    &f-link-SConscript; function call:

    </para>

    <scons_example name="separate_ex1">
      <file name="SConstruct" printme="1">
SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build')
      </file>
      <file name="src/SConscript">
env = Environment()
env.Program('hello.c')
      </file>
      <file name="src/hello.c">
int main() { printf("Hello, world!\n"); }
      </file>
    </scons_example>

    <para>

    &SCons; will then build all of the files in
    the &build; subdirectory:

    </para>

    <scons_output example="separate_ex1" suffix="1">
      <scons_output_command>ls src</scons_output_command>
      <scons_output_command>scons -Q</scons_output_command>
      <scons_output_command>ls src</scons_output_command>
      <scons_output_command>ls build</scons_output_command>
    </scons_output>

    <para>

    No files were built in &src;, they went to &build;.
    The build output might show a bit of a surprise:
    the object file
    <filename>build/hello.o</filename>
    and the executable file
    <filename>build/hello</filename>
    were built in the &build; subdirectory,
    as expected.
    But even though our &hello_c; file lives in the &src; subdirectory,
    &SCons; has actually compiled a
    <filename>build/hello.c</filename> file
    to create the object file,
    and that file is now seen in &build;.

    </para>

    <para>

    What's happened is that &SCons; has <emphasis>duplicated</emphasis>
    the &hello_c; file from the &src; subdirectory
    to the &build; subdirectory,
    and built the program from there (it also duplicated &SConscript;).
    The next section explains why &SCons; does this.

    </para>

  </section>

  <section>
  <title>Why &SCons; Duplicates Source Files in a Variant Directory Tree</title>

    <para>

    The main thing to understand is that when you set up a variant directory,
    &SCons; performs the build <emphasis>in that directory</emphasis>.
    It turns out it's easiest to ensure where build products end up
    by just building in place.
    Since the build is happening in a place different from where the
    sources are, the most straightforward way to guarantee a correct build
    is for &SCons; to copy them there.

    </para>

    <para>

    The most direct reason to duplicate source files
    in variant directories
    is simply that some tools (mostly older versions)
    are written to only build their output files
    in the same directory as the source files.
    In this case, the choices are either
    to build the output file in the source directory
    and move it to the variant directory,
    or to duplicate the source files in the variant directory.

    </para>

    <para>

    Additionally,
    relative references between files
    can cause problems if we don't
    just duplicate the hierarchy of source files
    in the variant directory.
    You can see this at work in
    use of the C preprocessor <literal>#include</literal>
    mechanism with double quotes, not angle brackets:

    </para>

    <sconstruct>
#include "file.h"
    </sconstruct>

    <para>

    The <emphasis>de facto</emphasis> standard behavior
    for most C compilers in this case
    is to first look in the same directory
    as the source file that contains the <literal>#include</literal> line,
    then to look in the directories in the preprocessor search path.
    Add to this that the &SCons; implementation of
    support for code repositories
    (described below)
    means not all of the files
    will be found in the same directory hierarchy,
    and the simplest way to make sure
    that the right include file is found
    is to duplicate the source files into the variant directory,
    which provides a correct build
    regardless of the original location(s) of the source files.

    </para>

    <para>

    Although source-file duplication guarantees a correct build
    even in these end-cases,
    it <emphasis>can</emphasis> usually be safely disabled.
    The next section describes
    how you can disable the duplication of source files
    in the variant directory.

    </para>

  </section>

  <section>
  <title>Telling &SCons; to Not Duplicate Source Files in the Variant Directory Tree</title>

    <para>

    In most cases and with most tool sets,
    &SCons; can place its target files in a build subdirectory
    <emphasis>without</emphasis>
    duplicating the source files
    and everything will work just fine.
    You can disable the default &SCons; behavior
    by specifying <literal>duplicate=False</literal>
    when you call the &SConscript; function:

    </para>

    <sconstruct>
SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build', duplicate=False)
    </sconstruct>

    <para>

    When this flag is specified,
    &SCons; uses the variant directory
    like most people expect--that is,
    the output files are placed in the variant directory
    while the source files stay in the source directory:

    </para>

    <screen>
% <userinput>ls src</userinput>
SConscript
hello.c
% <userinput>scons -Q</userinput>
cc -c src/hello.c -o build/hello.o
cc -o build/hello build/hello.o
% <userinput>ls build</userinput>
hello
hello.o
    </screen>

  </section>

  <section>
  <title>The &VariantDir; Function</title>

    <para>

    Use the &VariantDir; function to establish that target
    files should be built in a separate directory
    from the source files:

    </para>

    <scons_example name="separate_builddir">
      <file name="SConstruct" printme="1">
VariantDir('build', 'src')
env = Environment()
env.Program('build/hello.c')
      </file>
      <file name="src/hello.c">
int main() { printf("Hello, world!\n"); }
      </file>
    </scons_example>

    <para>

    Note that when you're not using
    an &SConscript; file in the &src; subdirectory,
    you must actually specify that
    the program must be built from
    the <filename>build/hello.c</filename>
    file that &SCons; will duplicate in the
    &build; subdirectory.

    </para>

    <para>

    When using the &VariantDir; function directly,
    &SCons; still duplicates the source files
    in the variant directory by default:

    </para>

    <scons_output example="separate_builddir" suffix="1">
      <scons_output_command>ls src</scons_output_command>
      <scons_output_command>scons -Q</scons_output_command>
      <scons_output_command>ls build</scons_output_command>
    </scons_output>

    <para>

    You can specify the same <literal>duplicate=False</literal> argument
    that you can specify for an &SConscript; call:

    </para>

    <scons_example name="separate_duplicate0">
      <file name="SConstruct" printme="1">
VariantDir('build', 'src', duplicate=False)
env = Environment()
env.Program('build/hello.c')
      </file>
      <file name="src/hello.c">
int main() { printf("Hello, world!\n"); }
      </file>
    </scons_example>

    <para>

    In which case &SCons;
    will disable duplication of the source files:

    </para>

    <scons_output example="separate_duplicate0" suffix="1">
      <scons_output_command>ls src</scons_output_command>
      <scons_output_command>scons -Q</scons_output_command>
      <scons_output_command>ls build</scons_output_command>
    </scons_output>

  </section>

  <section>
  <title>Using &VariantDir; With an &SConscript; File</title>

    <para>

    Even when using the &VariantDir; function,
    it's more natural to use it with
    a subsidiary &SConscript; file,
    because then you don't have to adjust your individual
    build instructions to use the variant directory path.
    For example, if the
    <filename>src/SConscript</filename>
    looks like this:

    </para>

    <scons_example name="separate_builddir_sconscript">
      <file name="SConstruct">
VariantDir('build', 'src')
SConscript('build/SConscript')
      </file>
      <file name="src/SConscript" printme="1">
env = Environment()
env.Program('hello.c')
      </file>
      <file name="src/hello.c">
int main() { printf("Hello, world!\n"); }
      </file>
    </scons_example>

    <para>

    Then our &SConstruct; file could look like:

    </para>

    <scons_example_file example="separate_builddir_sconscript" name="SConstruct">
    </scons_example_file>

    <para>

    Yielding the following output:

    </para>

    <scons_output example="separate_builddir_sconscript" suffix="1">
      <scons_output_command>ls src</scons_output_command>
      <scons_output_command>scons -Q</scons_output_command>
      <scons_output_command>ls build</scons_output_command>
    </scons_output>

    <para>

    Notice that this is completely equivalent
    to the use of &SConscript; that we
    learned about in the previous section.

    </para>

  </section>

  <section>
  <title>Using &Glob; with &VariantDir;</title>

    <para>

    The &f-link-Glob; file name pattern matching function
    works just as usual when using &VariantDir;.
    For example, if the
    <filename>src/SConscript</filename>
    looks like this:

    </para>

    <scons_example name="separate_glob_builddir_sconscript">
      <file name="SConstruct">
VariantDir('build', 'src')
SConscript('build/SConscript')
      </file>
      <file name="src/SConscript" printme="1">
env = Environment()
env.Program('hello', Glob('*.c'))
      </file>
      <file name="src/f1.c">
#include "f2.h"
int main() { printf(f2()); }
      </file>
      <file name="src/f2.c">
const char * f2() { return("Hello, world!\n"); }
      </file>
      <file name="src/f2.h">
const char * f2();
      </file>
    </scons_example>

    <para>

    Then with the same &SConstruct; file as in the previous section,
    and source files <filename>f1.c</filename>
    and <filename>f2.c</filename> in src,
    we would see the following output:

    </para>

    <scons_output example="separate_glob_builddir_sconscript" suffix="1">
      <scons_output_command>ls src</scons_output_command>
      <scons_output_command>scons -Q</scons_output_command>
      <scons_output_command>ls build</scons_output_command>
    </scons_output>

    <para>

    The &Glob; function returns Nodes in the
    <filename>build/</filename> tree, as you'd expect.

    </para>
