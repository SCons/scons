"""
Verify that Configure tests work even after an earlier test fails.

This was broken in 0.98.3 because we'd mark the /usr/bin/g++ compiler
as having failed (because it was on the candidates list as the implicit
command dependency for both the object file and executable generated
for the configuration test) and then avoid trying to rebuild anything
else that used the "failed" Node.

Thanks to Ben Webb for the test case.
