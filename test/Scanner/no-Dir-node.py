Verify that use of a Scanner that searches a *PATH list doesn't create
nodes for directories that don't exist, so they don't get picked up
by DirScanner.

Under the covers, this tests the behavior of the SCons.Node.FS.find_file()
utility function that is used by the Scanner.Classic class to search
directories in variables such as $CPPPATH.
