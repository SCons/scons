"""
Phony compiler for testing SCons.

Copies its source file to the target file, dropping lines that match
a pattern, so we can recognize the tool has made a modification.

The first argument is the language (cc, c__, g77, etc.).

Recognizes a -x option to append the language to 'mygcc.out'
for tracing purposes.

Intended for use as $CC, $CXX, etc.
