"""
This is an obscure test case. When a file without a suffix is included in 
a c++ build and there is a directory with the same name as that file in a
sub-build directory, verify that an Errno 21 is not thrown upon trying to
recursively scan the contents of includes. The Errno 21 indicates that
the directory with the same name was trying to be scanned as the include
file, which it clearly is not.
