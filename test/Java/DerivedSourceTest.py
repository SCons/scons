Test of javac.py when building java code from derived sources.

Original issue definition:
Java emitter for derived sources outputs bogus class files.

Repeatable with any N-tier, with N > 1, Java derived-source builds where
any of the following conditions are meet:
1. The java class does not belong to the root package.
2. A java source (*.java) creates N targets (*.class) where N > 1.
