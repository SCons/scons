Test retrieving derived files from a CacheDir.

This tests the case reported by Jeff Petkau (SourceForge bug #694744)
where a target is source for another target with a scanner, which used
to cause us to push the file to the CacheDir after the build signature
had already been cleared (as a sign that the built file should now
be rescanned).
