"""
Phony c++ command for testing SCons.

Copies its source file to the target file, dropping lines that match
a pattern, so we can recognize the tool has made a modification.
Intended for use as the $CXX construction variable.

Note: mycxx.py differs from the general fixture file mycompile.py
in arg handling: that one is intended for use as a *COM consvar,
where no compiler consvars will be passed on, this one is intended
for use as $CXX, where arguments like -o come into play.
