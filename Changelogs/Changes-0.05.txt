RELEASE 0.05 - Thu, 21 Feb 2002 16:50:03 -0600

  From Chad Austin:

  - Set PROGSUFFIX to .exe under Cygwin.

  From Charles Crain:

  - Allow a library to specified as a command-line source file, not just
    in the LIBS construction variable.

  - Compensate for a bug in os.path.normpath() that returns '' for './'
    on WIN32.

  - More performance optimizations:  cache #include lines from files,
    eliminate unnecessary calls.

  - If a prefix or suffix contains white space, treat the resulting
    concatenation as separate arguments.

  - Fix irregularities in the way we fetch DevStudio information from
    the Windows registry, and in our registry error handling.

  From Steven Knight:

  - Flush stdout after print so it intermixes correctly with stderr
    when redirected.

  - Allow Scanners to return a list of strings, and document how to
    write your own Scanners.

  - Look up implicit (scanned) dependencies relative to the directory
    of file being scanned.

  - Make writing .sconsign files more robust by first trying to write
    to a temp file that gets renamed.

  - Create all of the directories for a list of targets before trying
    to build any of the targets.

  - WIN32 portability fixes in tests.

  - Allow the list of variables exported to an SConscript file to be
    a UserList, too.

  - Document the overlooked LIBPATH construction variable.
    (Bug reported by Eicke Godehardt.)

  - Fix so that Ignore() ignores indirect, implicit dependencies
    (included files), not just direct dependencies.

  - Put the man page in the Debian distribution.

  - Run HTML docs through tidy to clean up the HTML (for Konqueror).

  - Add preliminary support for Unicode strings.

  - Efficiency:  don't scan dependencies more than once during the
    walk of a tree.

  - Fix the -c option so it doesn't stop removing targets if one doesn't
    already exist.
    (Bug reported by Paul Connell.)

  - Fix the --debug=pdb option when run on Windows NT.
    (Bug reported by Paul Connell.)

  - Add support for the -q option.

  From Steve Leblanc:

  - Add support for the -u option.

  - Add .cc and .hh file suffixes to the C Scanner.

  From Anthony Roach:

  - Make the scons script return an error code on failures.

  - Add support for using code to generate a command to build a target.
