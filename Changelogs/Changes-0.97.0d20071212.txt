RELEASE 0.97.0d20071212 - Wed, 12 Dec 2007 09:29:32 -0600

  From Benoit Belley:

  - Fix occasional spurious rebuilds and inefficiency when using
    --implicit-cache and Builders that produce multiple targets.

  - Allow SCons to not have to know about the builders of generated
    files when BuildDir(duplicate=0) is used, potentially allowing some
    SConscript files to be ignored for smaller builds.

  From David Cournapeau:

  - Add a CheckTypeSize() call to configure contexts.

  From Ken Deeter:

  - Make the "contents" of Alias Nodes a concatenation of the children's
    content signatures (MD5 checksums), not a concatenation of the
    children's contents, to avoid using large amounts of memory during
    signature calculation.

  From Malte Helmert:

  - Fix a lot of typos in the man page and User's Guide.

  From Geoffrey Irving:

  - Speed up conversion of paths in .sconsign files to File or Dir Nodes.

  From Steven Knight:

  - Add an Options.UnknownOptions() method that returns any settings
    (from the command line, or whatever dictionary was passed in)
    that aren't known to the Options object.

  - Add a Glob() function.

  - When removing targets with the -c option, use the absolute path (to
    avoid problems interpreting BuildDir() when the top-level directory
    is the source directory).

  - Fix problems with Install() and InstallAs() when called through a
    clone (of a clone, ...) of a cloned construction environment.

  - When executing a file containing Options() settings, add the file's
    directory to sys.path (so modules can be imported from there) and
    explicity set __name__ to the name of the file so the statement's
    in the file can deduce the location if they need to.

  - Fix an O(n^2) performance problem when adding sources to a target
    through calls to a multi Builder (including Aliases).

  - Redefine the $WINDOWSPROGMANIFESTSUFFIX and
    $WINDOWSSHLIBMANIFESTSUFFIX variables so they pick up changes to
    the underlying $SHLIBSUFFIX and $PROGSUFFIX variables.

  - Add a GetBuildFailures() function that can be called from functions
    registered with the Python atexit module to print summary information
    about any failures encountered while building.

  - Return a NodeList object, not a Python list, when a single_source
    Builder like Object() is called with more than one file.

  - When searching for implicit dependency files in the directories
    in a $*PATH list, don't create Dir Nodes for directories that
    don't actually exist on-disk.

  - Add a Requires() function to allow the specification of order-only
    prerequisites, which will be updated before specified "downstream"
    targets but which don't actually cause the target to be rebuilt.

  - Restore the FS.{Dir,File,Entry}.rel_path() method.

  - Make the default behavior of {Source,Target}Signatures('timestamp')
    be equivalent to 'timestamp-match', not 'timestamp-newer'.

  - Fix use of CacheDir with Decider('timestamp-newer') by updating
    the modification time when copying files from the cache.

  - Fix random issues with parallel (-j) builds on Windows when Python
    holds open file handles (especially for SCons temporary files,
    or targets built by Python function actions) across process creation.

  From Maxim Kartashev:

  - Fix test scripts when run on Solaris.

  From Gary Oberbrunner:

  - Fix Glob() when a pattern is in an explicitly-named subdirectory.

  From Philipp Scholl:

  - Fix setting up targets if multiple Package builders are specified
    at once.
