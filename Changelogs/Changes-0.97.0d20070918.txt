RELEASE 0.97.0d20070918 - Tue, 18 Sep 2007 10:51:27 -0500

  From Steven Knight:

  - Fix the wix Tool module to handle null entries in $PATH variables.

  - Move the documentation of Install() and InstallAs() from the list
    of functions to the list of Builders (now that they're implemented
    as such).

  - Allow env.CacheDir() to be set per construction environment.  The
    global CacheDir() function now sets an overridable global default.

  - Add an env.Decider() method and a Node.Decider() method that allow
    flexible specification of an arbitrary function to decide if a given
    dependency has changed since the last time a target was built.

  - Don't execute Configure actions (while reading SConscript files)
    when cleaning (-c) or getting help (-h or -H).

  - Add to each target an implicit dependency on the external command(s)
    used to build the target, as found by searching env['ENV']['PATH']
    for the first argument on each executed command line.

  - Add support for a $IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES construction
    variabe that can be used to disable the automatic implicit
    dependency on executed commands.

  - Add an "ensure_suffix" keyword to Builder() definitions that, when
    true, will add the configured suffix to the targets even if it looks
    like they already have a different suffix.

  - Add a Progress() function that allows for calling a function or string
    (or list of strings) to display progress while walking the DAG.

  - Allow ParseConfig(), MergeFlags() and ParseFlags() to handle output
    from a *config command with quoted path names that contain spaces.

  - Make the Return() function stop processing the SConscript file and
    return immediately.  Add a "stop=" keyword argument that can be set
    to False to preserve the old behavior.

  - Fix use of exitstatfunc on an Action.

  - Introduce all man page function examples with "Example:" or "Examples:".

  - When a file gets added to a directory, make sure the directory gets
    re-scanned for the new implicit dependency.

  - Fix handling a file that's specified multiple times in a target
    list so that it doesn't cause dependent Nodes to "disappear" from
    the dependency graph walk.

  From Carsten Koch:

  - Avoid race conditions with same-named files and directory creation
    when pushing copies of files to CacheDir().

  From Tzvetan Mikov:

  - Handle $ in Java class names.

  From Gary Oberbrunner:

  - Add support for the Intel C compiler on Windows64.

  - On SGI IRIX, have $SHCXX use $CXX by default (like other platforms).

  From Sohail Somani:

  - When Cloning a construction environment, set any variables before
    applying tools (so the tool module can access the configured settings)
    and re-set them after (so they end up matching what the user set).

  From Matthias Troffaes:

  - Make sure extra auxiliary files generated by some LaTeX packages
    and not ending in .aux also get deleted by scons -c.

  From Greg Ward:

  - Add a $JAVABOOTCLASSPATH variable for directories to be passed to the
    javac -bootclasspath option.

  From Christoph Wiedemann:

  - Add implicit dependencies on the commands used to build a target.
