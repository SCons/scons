RELEASE 0.98.5 - Sat, 07 Jun 2008 08:20:35 -0700

  From Benoit Belley:

  - Fix the Intel C++ compiler ABI specification for EMT64 processors.

  From David Cournapeau:

  - Issue a (suppressable) warning, not an error, when trying to link
    C++ and Fortran object files into the same executable.

  From Steven Knight:

  - Update the scons.bat file so that it returns the real exit status
    from SCons, even though it uses setlocal + endlocal.

  - Fix the --interactive post-build messages so it doesn't get stuck
    mistakenly reporting failures after any individual build fails.

  - Fix calling File() as a File object method in some circumstances.

  - Fix setup.py installation on Mac OS X so SCons gets installed
    under /usr/lcoal by default, not in the Mac OS X Python framework.
