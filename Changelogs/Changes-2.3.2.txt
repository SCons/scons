      and integrated with the C and C++ linking. NOTE: This is only tested
      with D v2. Support for D v1 is now deprecated.

  From Anatoly Techtonik:
    - Several improvements for running scons.py from source:
      * engine files form source directory take priority over all other
        importable versions
      * message about scons.py running from source is removed to fix tests
        that were failing because of this extra line in the output
      * error message when SCons import fails now lists lookup paths
    - Remove support for QMTest harness from runtest.py
    - Remove RPM and m4 from default tools on Windows
    - BitKeeper, CVS, Perforce, RCS, SCCS are deprecated from default
      tools and will be removed in future SCons versions to speed up
      SCons initialization (it will still be possible to use these tools
      explicitly)

  From Sye van der Veen:
    - Support for Visual Studio 12.0Exp, and fixes for earlier MSVS
      versions.
