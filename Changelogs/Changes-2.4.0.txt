RELEASE 2.4.0 - Mon, 21 Sep 2015 08:56:00 -0700

  From Dirk Baechle:
    - Switched several core classes to use "slots", to
      reduce the overall memory consumption in large
      projects (fixes #2180, #2178, #2198)
    - Memoizer counting uses decorators now, instead of
      the old metaclasses approach.

  From Andrew Featherstone
    - Fixed typo in SWIGPATH description
