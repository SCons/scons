RELEASE 0.04 - Wed, 30 Jan 2002 11:09:42 -0600

  From Charles Crain:

  - Significant performance improvements in the Node.FS and
    Scanner subsystems.

  - Fix signatures of binary files on Win32 systems.

  - Allow LIBS and LIBPATH to be strings, not just arrays.

  - Print a traceback if a Python-function builder throws an exception.

  From Steven Knight:

  - Fix using a directory as a Default(), and allow Default() to
    support white space in file names for strings in arrays.

  - Man page updates:  corrected some mistakes, documented various
    missing Environment methods, alphabetized the construction
    variables and other functions, defined begin and end macros for
    the example sections, regularized white space separation, fixed
    the use of Export() in the Multiple Variants example.

  - Function action fixes:  None is now a successful return value.
    Exceptions are now reported.  Document function actions.

  - Add 'Action' and 'Scanner' to the global keywords so SConscript
    files can use them too.

  - Removed the Wrapper class between Nodes and Walkers.

  - Add examples using Library, LIBS, and LIBPATH.

  - The C Scanner now always returns a sorted list of dependencies
    so order changes don't cause unnecessary rebuilds.

  - Strip $(-$) bracketed text from command lines.  Use this to
    surround $_INCDIRS and $_LIBDIRS so we don't rebuild in response
    to changes to -I or -L options.

  - Add the Ignore() method to ignore dependencies.

  - Provide an error message when a nonexistent target is specified
    on the command line.

  - Remove targets before building them, and add an Environment
    Precious() method to override that.

  - Eliminate redundant calls to the same builder when the target is a
    list of targets:  Add a ListBuilder class that wraps Builders to
    handle lists atomically.  Extend the Task class to support building
    and updating multiple targets in a single Task.  Simplify the
    interface between Task and Taskmaster.

  - Add a --debug=pdb option to re-run SCons under the Python debugger.

  - Only compute a build signature once for each node.

  - Changes to our sys.path[] manipulation to support installation into
    an arbitrary --prefix value.

  From Steve Leblanc:

  - Add var=value command-line arguments.
