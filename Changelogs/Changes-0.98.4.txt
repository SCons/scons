RELEASE 0.98.4 - Sat, 17 May 2008 22:14:46 -0700

  From Benoit Belley:

  - Fix calculation of signatures for Python function actions with
    closures in Python versions before 2.5.

  From David Cournapeau:

  - Fix the initialization of $SHF77FLAGS so it includes $F77FLAGS.

  From Jonas Olsson:

  - Fix a syntax error in the Intel C compiler support on Windows.

  From Steven Knight:

  - Change how we represent Python Value Nodes when printing and when
    stored in .sconsign files (to avoid blowing out memory by storing
    huge strings in .sconsign files after multiple runs using Configure
    contexts cause the Value strings to be re-escaped each time).

  - Fix a regression in not executing configuration checks after failure
    of any configuration check that used the same compiler or other tool.

  - Handle multiple destinations in Visual Studio 8 settings for the
    analogues to the INCLUDE, LIBRARY and PATH variables.

  From Greg Noel:

  - Update man page text for VariantDir().
