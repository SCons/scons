RELEASE 0.96.1 - Mon, 23 Aug 2004 12:55:50 +0000

  From Craig Bachelor:

  - Handle white space in the executable Python path name within in MSVS
    project files by quoting the path.

  - Correct the format of a GUID string in a solution (.dsw) file so
    MSVS can correctly "build enable" a project.

  From Steven Knight:

  - Add a must_exist flag to Delete() to let the user control whether
    it's an error if the specified entry doesn't exist.  The default
    behavior is now to silently do nothing if it doesn't exist.

  - Package up the new Platform/darwin.py, mistakenly left out of 0.96.

  - Make the scons.bat REM statements into @REM so they aren't printed.

  - Make the SCons packaging SConscript files platform independent.

  From Anthony Roach:

  - Fix scanning of pre-compiled header (.pch) files for #includes,
    broken in 0.96.
