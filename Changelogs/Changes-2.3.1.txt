RELEASE 2.3.1

  From Andrew Featherstone:
    - Added support for EPUB output format to the DocBook tool.

  From Tom Tanner:
    - Stop leaking file handles to subprocesses by switching to using subprocess
      always.
    - Allow multiple options to be specified with --debug=a,b,c
    - Add support for a readonly cache (--cache-readonly)
    - Always print stats if requested
    - Generally try harder to print out a message on build errors
    - Adds a switch to warn on missing targets
    - Add Pseudo command to mark targets which should not exist after
      they are built.

  From Bogdan Tenea:
    - Check for 8.3 filenames on cygwin as well as win32 to make variant_dir work properly.

  From Alexandre Feblot:
    - Make sure SharedLibrary depends on all dependent libs (by depending on SHLINKCOM)

  From Stefan Sperling:
    - Fixed the setup of linker flags for a versioned SharedLibrary
      under OpenBSD (#2916).

  From Antonio Cavallo:
    - Improve error if Visual Studio bat file not found.

  From Manuel Francisco Naranjo:
    - Allow Subst.Literal string objects to be compared with each other,
      so they work better in AddUnique() and Remove().

  From David Rothenberger:
    - Added cyglink linker that uses Cygwin naming conventions for
      shared libraries and automatically generates import libraries.

  From Dirk Baechle:
    - Update bootstrap.py so it can be used from any dir, to run
      SCons from a source (non-installed) dir.
    - Count statistics of instances are now collected only when
      the --debug=count command-line option is used (#2922).
    - Added release_target_info() to File nodes, which helps to
      reduce memory consumption in clean builds and update runs
      of large projects.
    - Fixed the handling of long options in the command-line
      parsing (#2929).
    - Fixed misspelled variable in intelc.py (#2928).

  From Gary Oberbrunner:
    - Test harness: fail_test() can now print a message to help debugging.

  From Anatoly Techtonik:
    - Require rpmbuild when building SCons package.
    - Print full stack on certain errors, for debugging.
    - Improve documentation for Textfile builder.

  From William Deegan:
    - VS2012 & VS2010 Resolve initialization issues by adding path to reg.exe
      in shell used to run batch files.
    - MSVC Support fixed defaulting TARGET_ARCH to HOST_ARCH. It should be
      None if not explicitly set.
    - MSVC Fixed issue where if more than one Architectures compilers are
      detected, it would take the last one found, and not the first.

  From Philipp Kraus:
    - Added optional ZIPROOT to Zip tool.

  From Dirk Baechle:
    - Replaced old SGML-based documentation toolchain with a more modern
      approach, that also requires less external dependencies (programs and
      Python packages). Added a customized Docbook XSD for strict validation of
      all input XML files.

  From Luca Falavigna:
    - Fixed spelling errors in MAN pages (#2897).

  From Michael McDougall:
