RELEASE 0.97 - Thu, 17 May 2007 08:59:41 -0500

  From Steven Knight:

  - Fix a bug that would make parallel builds stop in their tracks if
    Nodes that depended on lists that contained some Nodes built together
    caused the reference count to drop below 0 if the Nodes were visited
    and commands finished in the wrong order.

  - Make sure the DirEntryScanner doesn't choke if it's handed something
    that's not a directory (Node.FS.Dir) Node.
