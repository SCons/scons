RELEASE 0.98.1 - Fri, 18 Apr 2008 19:11:58 -0700

  From Benoit Belley:

  - Speed up the SCons.Util.to_string*() functions.

  - Optimize various Node intialization and calculations.

  - Optimize Executor scanning code.

  - Optimize Taskmaster execution, including dependency-cycle checking.

  - Fix the --debug=stree option so it prints its tree once, not twice.

  From Johan Boulï¿½:

  - Fix the ability to use LoadableModule() under MinGW.

  From David Cournapeau:

  - Various missing Fortran-related construction variables have been added.

  - SCons now uses the program specified in the $FORTRAN construction
    variable to link Fortran object files.

  - Fortran compilers on Linux (Intel, g77 and gfortran) now add the -fPIC
    option by default when compilling shared objects.

  - New 'sunf77', 'sunf90' and 'sunf95' Tool modules have been added to
    support Sun Fortran compilers.  On Solaris, the Sun Fortran compilers
    are used in preference to other compilers by default.

  - Fortran support now uses gfortran in preference to g77.

  - Fortran file suffixes are now configurable through the
    $F77FILESUFFIXES, $F90FILESUFFIXES, $F95FILESUFFIXES and
    $FORTRANFILESUFFIXES variables.

  From Steven Knight:

  - Make the -d, -e, -w and --no-print-directory options "Ignored for
    compatibility."  (We're not going to implement them.)

  - Fix a serious inefficiency in how SCons checks for whether any source
    files are missing when a Builder call creates many targets from many
    input source files.

  - In Java projects, make the target .class files depend only on the
    specific source .java files where the individual classes are defined.

  - Don't store duplicate source file entries  in the .sconsign file so
    we don't endlessly rebuild the target(s) for no reason.

  - Add a Variables object as the first step towards deprecating the
    Options object name.  Similarly, add BoolVariable(), EnumVariable(),
    ListVariable(), PackageVariable() and PathVariable() functions
    as first steps towards replacing BoolOption(), EnumOption(),
    ListOption(), PackageOption() and PathOption().

  - Change the options= keyword argument to the Environment() function
    to variables=, to avoid confusion with SCons command-line options.
    Continue supporting the options= keyword for backwards compatibility.

  - When $SWIGFLAGS contains the -python flag, expect the generated .py
    file to be in the same (sub)directory as the target.

  - When compiling C++ files, allow $CCFLAGS settings to show up on the
    command line even when $CXXFLAGS has been redefined.

  - Fix --interactive with -u/-U/-D when a VariantDir() is used.

  From Anatoly Techtonik:

  - Have the scons.bat file add the script execution directory to its
    local %PATH% on Windows, so the Python executable can be found.

  From Mike Wake:

  - Fix passing variable names as a list to the Return() function.

  From Matthew Wesley:

  - Add support for the GDC 'D' language compiler.
