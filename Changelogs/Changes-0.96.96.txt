  From Joe Bloggs:

  - Man page fix:  remove cut-and-paste sentence in NoCache() description.

  From Dmitry Grigorenko and Gary Oberbrunner:

  - Use the Intel C++ compiler, not $CC, to link C++ source.

  From Helmut Grohne:

  - Back out (most of) the Windows registry installer patch, which
    seems to not work on some versions of Windows.

  - Don't treat Java ".class" attributes as defining an inner class.

  - Fix detecting an erroneous Java anonymous class when the first
    non-skipped token after a "new" keyword is a closing brace.

  - Fix a regression when a CPPDEFINES list contains a tuple, the second
    item of which (the option value) is a construction variable expansion
    (e.g. $VALUE) and the value of the variable isn't a string.

  - Improve the error message if an IOError (like trying to read a
    directory as a file) occurs while deciding if a node is up-to-date.

  - Fix "maximum recursion" / "unhashable type" errors in $CPPPATH
    PathList expansion if a subsidiary expansion yields a stringable,
    non-Node object.

  - Generate API documentation from the docstrings (using epydoc).

  - Fix use of --debug=presub with Actions for out-of-the-box Builders.

  - Fix handling nested lists within $CPPPATH, $LIBPATH, etc.

  - Fix a "builders_used" AttributeError that real-world Qt initialization
    triggered in the refactored suffix handling for Builders.

  - Make the reported --debug=time timings meaningful when used with -j.
    Better documentation of what the times mean.

  - User Guide updates: --random, AlwaysBuild(), --tree=,
    --debug=findlibs, --debug=presub, --debug=stacktrace,
    --taskmastertrace.

  - Document (in both man page and User's Guide) that --implicit-cache

    .bib file.

  From Joel B. Mohler:

    Precious so their removal doesn't affect whether the necessary
    sections are included in output PDF or PostScript files.

  From Gary Oberbrunner:

  - Fix the ability to import modules in the site_scons directory from
    a subdirectory.

  From Adam Simpkins:

  - Make sure parallel (-j) builds all targets even if they show up
    multiple times in the child list (as a source and a dependency).

  From Matthias Troffaes:

  - Don't re-run TeX if the triggering strings (\makeindex, \bibliography
    \tableofcontents) are commented out.

  - Fix use of custom include and lib paths with Visual Studio 8.

  - Select the default .NET Framework SDK Dir based on the version of
    Visual Studio being used.
