    - Hide deprecated --debug={dtree,stree,tree} from --help output
    - Error messages from option parser now include hints about valid choices

      to run on anything less than Python 2.4 anymore
    - Several fixes for runtest.py:
      * exit with an error if no tests were found
      * removed --noqmtest option - this behavior is by default
      * replaced `-o FILE --xml` combination with `--xml FILE`
      * changed `-o, --output FILE` option to capture stdout/stderr output
        from runtest.py
    - Remove os_spawnv_fix.diff patch required to enable parallel builds
      support prior to Python 2.2

  From Juan Lang:
    - Fix WiX Tool to use .wixobj rather than .wxiobj for compiler output

  From eyan on Bitbucket:
    - Print target name with command execution time with --debug=time

  From Dirk Baechle:

      added ability to test external (out-of-tree) tools (#2862).
      See doc in QMTest/test-framework.rst.
    - Fixed several errors in the test suite (Java paths, MSVS version
      detection, Tool import), additionally
      * provided MinGW command-line support for the CXX, AS and
        Fortran tests,
      * refactored the detection of the gcc version and the according
        Fortran startup library,
      * provided a new module rpmutils.py, wrapping the RPM naming rules
        for target files and further hardware-dependent info (compatibility,
        compiler flags, ...),
      * added new test methods must_exist_one_of() and
        must_not_exist_any_of() and
      * removed Aegis support from runtest.py. (#2872)

  From Gary Oberbrunner:
    - Add -jN support to runtest.py to run tests in parallel
    - Add MSVC10 and MSVC11 support to get_output low-level bat script runner.
    - Fix MSVS solution generation for VS11, and fixed tests.

  From Rob Managan:
    - Updated the TeX builder to support the \newglossary command
      in LaTeX's glossaries package and the files it creates.
    - Improve support for new versions of biblatex in the TeX builder
      so biber is called automatically if biblatex requires it.
    - Add SHLIBVERSION as an option that tells SharedLibrary to build
      a versioned shared library and create the required symlinks.
      Add builder InstallVersionedLib to create the required symlinks
      installing a versioned shared library.
