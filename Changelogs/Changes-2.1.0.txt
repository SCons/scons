RELEASE 2.1.0 - Mon, 09 Sep 2011 20:54:57 -0700

  From Anton Lazarev:
    - Fix Windows resource compiler scanner to accept DOS line endings.

  From Matthias:
    - Update MSVS documents to remove note indicating that only one
      project is currently supported per solution file.

  From Grzegorz Bizoń:
    - Fix long compile lines in batch mode by using TEMPFILE
    - Fix MSVC_BATCH=False (was treating it as true)

  From Justin Gullingsrud:
    - support -std=c++0x and related CXXFLAGS in pkgconfig (ParseFlags)

  From Vincent Beffara:
    - Support -dylib_file in pkgconfig (ParseFlags)

  From Gary Oberbrunner and Sohail Somani:
    - new construction variable WINDOWS_EMBED_MANIFEST to automatically
      embed manifests in Windows EXEs and DLLs.

  From Gary Oberbrunner:
    - Fix Visual Studio project generation when CPPPATH contains Dir nodes
    - Ensure Visual Studio project is regenerated when CPPPATH or CPPDEFINES change
    - Fix unicode error when using non-ASCII filenames with Copy or Install
    - Put RPATH in LINKCOM rather than LINKFLAGS so resetting
      LINKFLAGS doesn't kill RPATH
    - Fix precompiled headers on Windows when variant dir name has spaces.
    - Adding None to an Action no longer fails (just returns original action)
    - New --debug=prepare option to show each target as it's being
      prepared, whether or not anything needs to be done for it.
    - New debug option --debug=duplicate to print a line for each
      unlink/relink (or copy) of a variant file from its source file.
    - Improve error message for EnumVariables to show legal values.
    - Fix Intel compiler to sort versions >9 correctly (esp. on Linux)
    - Fix Install() when the source and target are directories and the
      target directory exists.

  From David Garcia Garzon:
    - Fix Delete to be able to delete broken symlinks and dir
      symlinks.

  From Imran Fanaswala and Robert Lehr:
    - Handle .output file generated by bison/yacc properly. Cleaning it
      when necessary.

  From Antoine Dechaume:
    - Handle SWIG file where there is whitespace after the module name
      properly. Previously the generated files would include
      the whitespace.

  From Dmitry R.:
    - Handle Environment in case __semi_deepcopy is None

  From Benoit Belley:

    - Much improved support for Windows UNC paths (\\SERVERNAME).

  From Jean-Baptiste Lab:

    - Fix problems with appending CPPDEFINES that contain
      dictionaries, and related issues with Parse/MergeFlags and
      CPPDEFINES.

  From Allen Weeks:

    - Fix for an issue with implicit-cache with multiple targets
      when dependencies are removed on disk.

  From Evgeny Podjachev and Alexey Petruchick:

    - Support generation of Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 (9.0)
      and 2010 (10.0) project and solution files.

  From Ken Deeter:

    - Fix a problem when FS Entries which are actually Dirs have builders.

  From Luca Falavigna:

    - Support Fortran 03

  From Gary Oberbrunner:

    - Print the path to the SCons package in scons --version

  From Jean-Franï¿½ois Colson:

    - Improve Microsoft Visual Studio Solution generation, and fix
      various errors in the generated solutions especially when using
      MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER, and when generating multiple projects.  The
      construction variable MSVS_SCC_PROJECT_BASE_PATH, which never
      worked properly, is removed.  Users can use the new variable
      MSVS_SCC_CONNECTION_ROOT instead if desired.

  From Anatoly Techtonik:

    - Use subprocess in bootstrap.py instead of os.execve to avoid
      losing output control on Windows (http://bugs.python.org/issue9148)

    - Revert patch for adding SCons to App Paths, because standard cmd
      shell doesn't search there. This is confusing, because `scons` can
      be executed from explorer, but fail to start from console.

    - Fix broken installation with easy_install on Windows (issue #2051)
      SCons traditionally installed in a way that allowed to run multiple
      versions side by side. This custom logic was incompatible with
      easy_install way of doing things.

    - Use epydoc module for generating API docs in HTML if command line
      utility is not found in PATH. Actual for Windows.

  From Alexander Goomenyuk:

    - Add .sx to assembly source scanner list so .sx files
      get their header file dependencies detected.

  From Arve Knudsen:

    - Set module metadata when loading site_scons/site_init.py
      so it is treated as a proper module; __doc__, __file__ and
      __name__ now refer to the site_init.py file.

  From Russel Winder:

    - Users Guide updates explaining that Tools can be packages as
      well as python modules.

  From Gary Oberbrunner:

    - New systemwide and per-user site_scons dirs.

  From Dirk Baechle:

    - XML fixes in User's Guide.
    - Fixed the detection of 'jar' and 'rmic' during
      the initialization of the respective Tools (#2730).
    - Improved docs for custom Decider functions and
      custom Scanner objects (#2711, #2713).
    - Corrected SWIG module names for generated *.i files (#2707).

  From Joe Zuntz:

    - Fixed a case-sensitivity problem with Fortran modules.

  From Bauke Conijn:

    - Added Users Guide example for auto-generated source code

  From Steven Knight:

    - Fix explicit dependencies (Depends()) on Nodes that don't have
      attached Builders.

    - Fix use of the global Alias() function with command actions.

  From Matt Hughes:

    - Fix the ability to append to default $*FLAGS values (which are
      implemented as CLVar instances) in a copied construction environment
      without affecting the original construction environment's value.

  From Rob Managan:

    - Updated the TeX command strings to include a /D on Windows in
      case the new directory is on a different drive letter.

    - Fixed the LaTeX scanner so dependencies are found in commands that
      are broken across lines with a comment or have embedded spaces.

    - The TeX builders should now work with tex files that are generated
      by another program. Thanks to Hans-Martin von Gaudecker for
      isolating the cause of this bug.

    - Added support for INDEXSTYLE environment variable so makeindex can
      find style files.

    - Added support for the bibunits package so we call bibtex on all
      the bu*.aux files.

    - Add support of finding path information on OSX for TeX applications
      MacPorts and Fink paths need to be added by the user

  From Russel Winder:

    - Add support for DMD version 2 (the phobos2 library).

  From William Deegan:

    - Add initial support for VS/VC 2010 (express and non-express versions)
    - Remove warning for not finding MS VC/VS install.
      "scons: warning: No version of Visual Studio compiler found
        - C/C++ compilers most likely not set correctly"
    - Add support for Linux 3.0
