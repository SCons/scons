RELEASE 1.2.0.d20090113 - Tue, 13 Jan 2009 02:50:30 -0800

  From Stanislav Baranov, Ted Johnson and Steven Knight:

    - Add support for batch compilation of Visual Studio C/C++ source
      files, controlled by a new $MSVC_BATCH construction variable.

  From Steven Knight:

    - Print the message, "scons: Build interrupted." on error output,
      not standard output.

    - Add a --warn=future-deprecated option for advance warnings about
      deprecated features that still have warnings hidden by default.

    - Fix use of $SOURCE and $SOURCES attributes when there are no
      sources specified in the Builder call.

    - Add support for new $CHANGED_SOURCES, $CHANGED_TARGETS,
      $UNCHANGED_SOURCES and $UNCHANGED_TARGETS variables.

    - Add general support for batch builds through new batch_key= and
      targets= keywords to Action object creation.

  From Arve Knudsen:

    - Make linker tools differentiate properly between SharedLibrary
      and LoadableModule.

    - Document TestCommon.shobj_prefix variable.

    - Support $SWIGOUTDIR values with spaces.

  From Rob Managan:

    - Don't automatically try to build .pdf graphics files for
      .eps files in \includegraphics{} calls in TeX/LaTeX files
      when building with the PDF builder (and thus using pdflatex).

  From Gary Oberbrunner:

    - Allow AppendENVPath() and PrependENVPath() to interpret '#'
      for paths relative to the top-level SConstruct directory.

    - Use the Borland ilink -e option to specify the output file name.

    - Document that the msvc Tool module uses $PCH, $PCHSTOP and $PDB.

    - Allow WINDOWS_INSERT_DEF=0 to disable --output-def when linking
      under MinGW.

  From Zia Sobhani:

    - Fix typos in the User's Guide.

  From Greg Spencer:

    - Support implicit dependency scanning of files encoded in utf-8
      and utf-16.

  From Roberto de Vecchi:

    - Remove $CCFLAGS from the the default definitions of $CXXFLAGS for
      Visual C/C++ and MIPSpro C++ on SGI so, they match other tools
      and avoid flag duplication on C++ command lines.

  From Ben Webb:

    - Handle quoted module names in SWIG source files.

    - Emit *_wrap.h when SWIG generates header file for directors

  From Matthew Wesley:

    - Copy file attributes so we identify, and can link a shared library
      from, shared object files in a Repository.
