RELEASE 0.90 - Wed, 25 Jun 2003 14:24:52 -0500

  From Chad Austin:

  - Fix the _concat() documentation, and add a test for it.

  - Portability fixes for non-GNU versions of lex and yacc.

  From Matt Balvin:

  - Fix handling of library prefixes when the subdirectory matches
    the prefix.

  From Timothee Bessett:

  - Add an M4 Builder.

  From Charles Crain:

  - Use '.lnk' as the suffix on the temporary file for linking long
    command lines (necessary for the Phar Lap linkloc linker).

  - Save non-string Options values as their actual type.

  - Save Options string values that contain a single quote correctly.

  - Save any Options values that are changed from the default
    Environment values, not just ones changed on the command line or in
    an Options file.

  - Make closing the Options file descriptor exception-safe.

  From Steven Knight:

  - SCons now enforces (with an error) that construction variables
    must have the same form as valid Python identifiers.

  - Fix man page bugs: remove duplicate AddPostAction() description;
    document no_import_lib; mention that CPPFLAGS does not contain
    $_CPPINCFLAGS; mention that F77FLAGS does not contain $_F77INCFLAGS;
    mention that LINKFLAGS and SHLINKFLAGS contains neither $_LIBFLAGS
    nor $_LIBDIRFLAGS.

  - Eliminate a dependency on the distutils.fancy_getopt module by
    copying and pasting its wrap_text() function directly.

  - Make the Script.Options() subclass match the underlying base class
    implementation.

  - When reporting a target is up to date, quote the target like make
    (backquote-quote) instead of with double quotes.

  - Fix handling of ../* targets when using -U, -D or -u.

  From Steve Leblanc:

  - Don't update the .sconsign files when run with -n.

  From Gary Oberbrunner:

  - Add support for the Intel C Compiler (icl.exe).

  From Anthony Roach

  - Fix Import('*').

  From David Snopek

  - Fix use of SConf in paths with white space in them.

  - Add CheckFunc and CheckType functionality to SConf.

  - Fix use of SConf with Builders that return a list of nodes.

  From David Snopek and Christoph Wiedemann

  - Fix use of the SConf subsystem with SConscriptChdir().

  From Greg Spencer

  - Check for the existence of MS Visual Studio on disk before using it,
    to avoid getting fooled by leftover junk in the registry.

  - Add support for MSVC++ .NET.

  - Add support for MS Visual Studio project files (DSP, DSW,
    SLN and VCPROJ files).

  From Christoph Wiedemann

  - SConf now works correctly when the -n and -q options are used.
