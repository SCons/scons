RELEASE 4.5.1 -  Mon, 06 Mar 2023 14:08:29 -0700

  From Mats Wichmann
    - Fix a problem in 4.5.0 where using something like the following code
      will cause a Clone()'d environment to share the CPPDEFINES with the
      original Environment() which was cloned. Causing leakage of changes
      to CPPDEFINES when they should be completely independent after the Clone.
          env=Environment(CPPDEFINES=['a'])
          env.Append(CPPDEFINES=['b']) (or AppendUnique,Prepend,PrependUnique)
          env1=env.Clone()
          env1.Append(CPPDEFINES=['c']) (or any other modification, but not overwriting CPPDEFINES
      Now env['CPPDEFINES'] will contain 'c' when it should not.
