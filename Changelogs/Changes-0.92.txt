RELEASE 0.92 - Wed, 20 Aug 2003 03:45:28 -0500

  From Charles Crain and Gary Oberbrunner:

  - Fix Tool import problems with the Intel and PharLap linkers.

  From Steven Knight

  - Refactor the DictCmdGenerator class to be a Selector subclass.

  - Allow the DefaultEnvironment() function to take arguments and pass
    them to instantiation of the default construction environment.

  - Update the Debian package so it uses Python 2.2 and more closely
    resembles the currently official Debian packaging info.

  From Gerard Patel

  - When the yacc -d flag is used, take the .h file base name from the
    target .c file, not the source (matching what yacc does).
