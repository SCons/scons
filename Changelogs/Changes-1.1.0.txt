RELEASE 1.1.0 - Thu, 09 Oct 2008 08:33:47 -0700

  From Chris AtLee

    - Use the specified environment when checking for the GCC compiler
      version.

  From Ian P. Cardenas:

    - Fix Glob() polluting LIBPATH by returning copy of list

  From David Cournapeau:

    - Add CheckCC, CheckCXX, CheckSHCC and CheckSHCXX tests to
      configuration contexts.

    - Have the --profile= argument use the much faster cProfile module
      (if it's available in the running Python version).

    - Reorder MSVC compilation arguments so the /Fo is first.

  From Bill Deegan:

    - Add scanning Windows resource (.rc) files for implicit dependencies.

  From John Gozde:

    - When scanning for a #include file, don't use a directory that
      has the same name as the file.

  From Ralf W. Grosse-Kunstleve

    - Suppress error output when checking for the GCC compiler version.

  From Jared Grubb:

    - Fix VariantDir duplication of #included files in subdirectories.

  From Ludwig Hï¿½hne:

    - Reduce memory usage when a directory is used as a dependency of
      another Node (such as an Alias) by returning a concatenation
      of the children's signatures + names, not the children's contents,
      as the directory contents.

    - Raise AttributeError, not KeyError, when a Builder can't be found.

    - Invalidate cached Node information (such as the contenst returned
      by the get_contents() method) when calling actions with Execute().

    - Avoid object reference cycles from frame objects.

    - Reduce memory usage from Null Executor objects.

    - Compute MD5 checksums of large files without reading the entire
      file contents into memory.  Add a new --md5-chunksize option to
      control the size of each chunk read into memory.

  From Steven Knight:

    - Fix the ability of the add_src_builder() method to add a new
      source builder to any other builder.

    - Avoid an infinite loop on non-Windows systems trying to find the
      SCons library directory if the Python library directory does not
      begin with the string "python".

    - Search for the SCons library directory in "scons-local" (with
      no version number) after "scons-local-{VERSION}".

  From Rob Managan:

    - Fix the user's ability to interrupt the TeX build chain.

    - Fix the TeX builder's allowing the user to specify the target name,
      instead of always using its default output name based on the source.

    - Iterate building TeX output files until all warning are gone
      and the auxiliary files stop changing, or until we reach the
      (configurable) maximum number of retries.

    - Add TeX scanner support for:  glossaries, nomenclatures, lists of
      figures, lists of tables, hyperref and beamer.

    - Use the $BIBINPUTS, $BSTINPUTS, $TEXINPUTS and $TEXPICTS construction
      variables as search paths for the relevant types of input file.

    - Fix building TeX with VariantDir(duplicate=0) in effect.

    - Fix the LaTeX scanner to search for graphics on the TEXINPUTS path.

    - Have the PDFLaTeX scanner search for .gif files as well.

  From Greg Noel:

    - Fix typos and format bugs in the man page.

    - Add a first draft of a wrapper module for Python's subprocess
      module.

    - Refactor use of the SCons.compat module so other modules don't
      have to import it individually.

    - Add .sx as a suffix for assembly language files that use the
      C preprocessor.

  From Gary Oberbrunner:

    - Make Glob() sort the returned list of Files or Nodes
      to prevent spurious rebuilds.

    - Add a delete_existing keyword argument to the AppendENVPath()
      and PrependENVPath() Environment methods.

    - Add ability to use "$SOURCE" when specifying a target to a builder

  From Damyan Pepper:

    - Add a test case to verify that SConsignFile() files can be
      created in previously non-existent subdirectories.

  From Jim Randall:

    - Make the subdirectory in which the SConsignFile() file will
      live, if the subdirectory doesn't already exist.

  From Ali Tofigh:

    - Add a test to verify duplication of files in VariantDir subdirectories.
