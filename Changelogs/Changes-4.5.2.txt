RELEASE 4.5.2 -  Sun, 21 Mar 2023 14:08:29 -0700

  From Michał Górny:
    - Remove the redundant `wheel` dependency from `pyproject.toml`,
      as it is added automatically by the setuptools PEP517 backend.

  From Mats Wichmann
    -  Fix a problem (#4321) in 4.5.0/4.5.1 where ParseConfig could cause an
       exception in MergeFlags when the result would be to add preprocessor
       defines to existing CPPDEFINES. The following code illustrates the
       circumstances that could trigger this:
          env=Environment(CPPDEFINES=['a'])
          env.Append(CPPDEFINES=['b'])
          env.MergeFlags({'CPPDEFINES': 'c'})
