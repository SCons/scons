RELEASE 0.11 - Tue, 11 Feb 2003 05:24:33 -0600

  From Chad Austin:

  - Add support for IRIX and the SGI MIPSPro tool chain.

  - Support using the MSVC tool chain when running Cygwin Python.

  From Michael Cook:

  - Avoid losing signal bits in the exit status from a command,
    helping terminate builds on interrupt (CTRL+C).

  From Charles Crain:

  - Added new AddPreAction() and AddPostAction() functions that support
    taking additional actions before or after building specific targets.

  - Add support for the PharLap ETS tool chain.

  From Steven Knight:

  - Allow Python function Actions to specify a list of construction
    variables that should be included in the Action's signature.

  - Allow libraries in the LIBS variable to explicitly include the prefix
    and suffix, even when using the GNU linker.
    (Bug reported by Neal Becker.)

  - Use DOS-standard CR-LF line endings in the scons.bat file.
    (Bug reported by Gary Ruben.)

  - Doc changes:  Eliminate description of deprecated "name" keyword
    argument from Builder definition (reported by Gary Ruben).

  - Support using env.Append() on BUILDERS (and other dictionaries).
    (Bug reported by Bj=F6rn Bylander.)

  - Setting the BUILDERS construction variable now properly clears
    the previous Builder attributes from the construction Environment.
    (Bug reported by Bj=F6rn Bylander.)

  - Fix adding a prefix to a file when the target isn't specified.
    (Bug reported by Esa Ilari Vuokko.)

  - Clean up error messages from problems duplicating into read-only
    BuildDir directories or into read-only files.

  - Add a CommandAction.strfunction() method, and add an "env" argument
    to the FunctionAction.strfunction() method, so that all Action
    objects have strfunction() methods, and the functions for building
    and returning a string both take the same arguments.

  - Add support for new CacheDir() functionality to share derived files
    between builds, with related options --cache-disable, --cache-force,
    and --cache-show.

  - Change the default behavior when no targets are specified to build
    everything in the current directory and below (like Make).  This
    can be disabled by specifying Default(None) in an SConscript.

  - Revamp SCons installation to fix a case-sensitive installation
    on Win32 systems, and to add SCons-specific --standard-lib,
    --standalone-lib, and --version-lib options for easier user
    control of where the libraries get installed.

  - Fix the ability to directly import and use Platform and Tool modules
    that have been implicitly imported into an Environment().

  - Add support for allowing an embedding interface to annotate a node
    when it's created.

  - Extend the SConscript() function to accept build_dir and duplicate
    keyword arguments that function like a BuildDir() call.

  From Steve Leblanc:

  - Fix the output of -c -n when directories are involved, so it
    matches -c.

  From Anthony Roach:

  - Use a different shared object suffix (.os) when using gcc so shared
    and static objects can exist side-by-side in the same directory.

  - Allow the same object files on Win32 to be linked into either
    shared or static libraries.

  - Cache implicit cache values when using --implicit-cache.
