RELEASE 3.0.3 - Mon, 07 Jan 2019 20:05:22 -0400
  NOTE: 3.0.2 release was dropped because there was a packaging bug. Please consider all 3.0.2
        content.

  From William Deegan:
    - Fixes to packaging logic.  Ensuring the SCons.Tool.clangCommon module is added
      to the release packages.
    - Modify scons.bat script to check for scons python script without .py extension if no file
      scons.py exists. This enables an all platform wheel to work.

  From Mats Wichmann:
    - Update doc examples to work with Python 3.5+:  map() now returns an iterable instead of a list.
