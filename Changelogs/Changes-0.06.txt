RELEASE 0.06 - Thu, 28 Mar 2002 01:24:29 -0600

  From Charles Crain:

  - Fix command generators to expand construction variables.

  - Make FunctionAction arguments be Nodes, not strings.

  From Stephen Kennedy:

  - Performance:  Use a dictionary, not a list, for a Node's parents.

  From Steven Knight:

  - Add .zip files to the packages we build.

  - Man page:  document LIBS, fix a typo, document ARGUMENTS.

  - Added RANLIB and RANLIBFLAGS construction variables.  Only use them
    in ARCOM if there's a "ranlib" program on the system.

  - Add a configurable CFILESUFFIX for the Builder of .l and .y files
    into C files.

  - Add a CXXFile Builder that turns .ll and .yy files into .cc files
    (configurable via a CXXFILESUFFIX construction variable).

  - Use the POSIX-standard lex -t flag, not the GNU-specific -o flag.
    (Bug reported by Russell Christensen.)

  - Fixed an exception when CPPPATH or LIBPATH is a null string.
    (Bug reported by Richard Kiss.)

  - Add a --profile=FILE option to make profiling SCons easier.

  - Modify the new DVI builder to create .dvi files from LaTeX (.ltx
    and .latex) files.

  - Add support for Aliases (phony targets).

  - Add a WhereIs() method for searching for path names to executables.

  - Add PDF and PostScript document builders.

  - Add support for compiling Fortran programs from a variety of
    suffixes (a la GNU Make):  .f, .F, .for, .FOR, .fpp and .FPP

  - Support a CPPFLAGS variable on all default commands that use the
    C preprocessor.

  From Steve Leblanc:

  - Add support for the -U option.

  - Allow CPPPATH, LIBPATH and LIBS to be specified as white-space
    separated strings.

  - Add a document builder to create .dvi files from TeX (.tex) files.

  From Anthony Roach:

  - Fix:  Construction variables with values of 0 were incorrectly
    interpolated as ''.

  - Support env['VAR'] to fetch construction variable values.

  - Man page:  document Precious().
