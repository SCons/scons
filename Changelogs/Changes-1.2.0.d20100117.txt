RELEASE 1.2.0.d20100117 - Sun, 17 Jan 2010 14:26:59 -0800

  From Jim Randall:
    - Fixed temp filename race condition on Windows with long cmd lines.

  From David Cournapeau:
    - Fixed tryRun when sconf directory is in a variant dir.
    - Do not add -fPIC for ifort tool on non-posix platforms (darwin and
      windows).
    - Fix bug 2294 (spurious CheckCC failures).
    - Fix SCons bootstrap process on windows 64 (wrong wininst name)

  From William Deegan:
    - Final merge from vs_revamp branch to main

    - Added definition and usage of HOST_OS, HOST_ARCH, TARGET_OS,
      TARGET_ARCH, currently only defined/used by Visual Studio
      Compilers. This will be rolled out to other platforms/tools
      in the future.

    - Add check for python >= 3.0.0 and exit gracefully.
      For 1.3 python >= 1.5.2 and < 3.0.0 are supported

    - Fix bug 1944 - Handle non-existent .i file in swig emitter, previously
      it would crash with an IOError exception. Now it will try to make an
      educated guess on the module name based on the filename.

  From Lukas Erlinghagen:

    - Have AddOption() remove variables from the list of
      seen-but-unknown variables (which are reported later).

    - An option name and aliases can now be specified as a tuple.

  From Hartmut Goebel:

    - Textfile builder.

  From Jared Grubb:

    - use "is/is not" in comparisons with None instead of "==" or "!=".

  From Jim Hunziker:

    - Avoid adding -gphobos to a command line multiple times
      when initializing use of the DMD compiler.

  From Jason Kenney:

    - Sugguested HOST/TARGET OS/ARCH separation.

  From Steven Knight:

    - Fix the -n option when used with VariantDir(duplicate=1)
      and the variant directory doesn't already exist.

    - Fix scanning of Unicode files for both UTF-16 endian flavors.

    - Fix a TypeError on #include of file names with Unicode characters.

    - Fix an exception if a null command-line argument is passed in.

    - Evaluate Requires() prerequisites before a Node's direct children
      (sources and dependencies).

  From Greg Noel:

    - Remove redundant __metaclass__ initializations in Environment.py.

    - Correct the documentation of text returned by sconf.Result().

    - Document that filenames with '.' as the first character are
      ignored by Glob() by default (matching UNIX glob semantics).

    - Fix SWIG testing infrastructure to work on Mac OS X.

    - Restructure a test that occasionally hung so that the test would
      detect when it was stuck and fail instead.

    - Substfile builder.

  From Gary Oberbrunner:

    - When reporting a target that SCons doesn't know how to make,
      specify whether it's a File, Dir, etc.

  From Ben Webb:

    - Fix use of $SWIGOUTDIR when generating Python wrappers.

    - Add $SWIGDIRECTORSUFFIX and $SWIGVERSION construction variables.

  From Rob Managan:

    - Add -recorder flag to Latex commands and updated internals to
      use the output to find files TeX creates. This allows the MiKTeX
      installations to find the created files

    - Notify user of Latex errors that would get buried in the
      Latex output

    - Remove LATEXSUFFIXES from environments that don't initialize Tex.

    - Add support for the glossaries package for glossaries and acronyms

    - Fix problem that pdftex, latex, and pdflatex tools by themselves did
      not create the actions for bibtex, makeindex,... by creating them
      and other environment settings in one routine called by all four
      tex tools.

    - Fix problem with filenames of sideeffects when the user changes
      the name of the output file from the latex default

    - Add scanning of files included in Latex by means of \lstinputlisting{}
      Patch from Stefan Hepp.

    - Change command line for epstopdf to use --outfile= instead of -o
      since this works on all platforms.
      Patch from Stefan Hepp.

    - Change scanner to properly search for included file from the
      directory of the main file instead of the file it is included from.
      Also update the emitter to add the .aux file associated with
      \include{filename} commands. This makes sure the required directories
      if any are created for variantdir cases.
      Half of the patch from Stefan Hepp.
