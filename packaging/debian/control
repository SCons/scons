Description: A replacement for Make
 SCons is an Open Source software construction tool--that is, a build
 tool; an improved substitute for the classic Make utility; a better
 way to build software.  SCons is based on the design which won the
 Software Carpentry build tool design competition in August 2000.  SCons
 "configuration files" are Python scripts that call an API to establish
 dependencies and specify how targets are built.  SCons maintains a global
 view of all dependencies in a tree, and can scan source (or other) files
 for implicit dependencies, such as files specified on #include lines.
 SCons uses MD5 signatures to rebuild only when the contents of a file
 have really changed, not just when the timestamp has been touched.
 SCons supports side-by-side variant builds, and is easily extended with
 user-defined Builder and/or Scanner objects.
