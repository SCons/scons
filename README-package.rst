About SCons
-----------

This is SCons, a tool for building software (and other files).  SCons is
implemented in Python, and its "configuration files" are actually Python
scripts, allowing you to use the full power of a real scripting language
to solve build problems.  You do not, however, need to know Python to
use SCons effectively.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation for SCons is available at:

        http://www.scons.org/documentation.html

Requirements
------------

Running SCons requires Python 3.5 or higher. There should be no other
dependencies or requirements to run SCons.

As of SCons 4.2.0 support for Python 3.5 is deprecated and will be removed
with the next major release.

By default, SCons knows how to search for available programming tools on
various systems--see the SCons man page for details.  You may, of course,
override the default SCons choices made by appropriate configuration of
Environment construction variables.
