"""Dependency scanner for Python code.

One important note about the design is that this does not take any dependencies
upon packages or binaries in the Python installation unless they are listed in
PYTHONPATH. To do otherwise would have required code to determine where the
Python installation is, which is outside of the scope of a scanner like this.
If consumers want to pick up dependencies upon these packages, they must put
those directories in PYTHONPATH.
