"""SCons.RemoteCache

This class owns the logic related to pushing to and fetching from a Bazel
remote cache server. That server stores Task metadata in the /ac/ section
(action cache) and Node binary data in the /cas/ section (content-addressible
storage).

The Bazel remote cache uses LRU cache eviction for binaries in the
content-addressible storage. This means that Task metadata could exist in the
action cache /ac/ section but one or more of the Node binary data could be
missing due to eviction. Thus, in order for a Task to be fulfilled from cache,
we must verify that the Task metadata exists in the action cache and all Node
binary data exists in the content-addressible storage.

This class can be configured to do cache fetch, cache push, or both.

The first step of fetching a  Task is to issue a GET request to the /ac/
portion of the Bazel remote cache server. The server does validation of the
/ac/ request so it should only succeed if (1) the record exists on the server
and (2) the /cas/ storage has not evicted the nodes.

We use two ThreadPoolExecutor instances. The first instance is responsible for
fetching a task from cache; a request to that executor is done when an entire
task fetch is completed, either resulting in a cache hit or cache miss. The
second instance is response for singular network accesses; a request to that
executor is done when the specified network request is completed.

The second ThreadPoolExecutor is needed because the urllib3 API is synchronous
and we want multi-target tasks to be fetched in parallel. Requests to the first
ThreadPoolExecutor will wait on requests to the second ThreadPoolExecutor. If
we only used the one ThreadPoolExecutor and that executor was full of task
fetch requests, the cache would hang because there would be no room for the
individual network requests. We avoid that starvation by using the second
ThreadPoolExecutor.

For security purposes and due to requirements by the Bazel remote cache server,
/ac/ and /cas/ requests always use SHA-256. This requires that SCons uses
SHA-256 content signatures. The security reasons are primarily to avoid
collisions with other actions.
