    attempts to get or set the *env* or *builder* attributes, which were
    the names we used before we put the common functionality into the

class SubstitutionEnvironment:
    """Base class for different flavors of construction environments.

    This class contains a minimal set of methods that handle construction
    variable expansion and conversion of strings to Nodes, which may or
    may not be actually useful as a stand-alone class.  Which methods
    ended up in this class is pretty arbitrary right now.  They're
    basically the ones which we've empirically determined are common to
    the different construction environment subclasses, and most of the
    others that use or touch the underlying dictionary of construction
    variables.

    Eventually, this class should contain all the methods that we
    determine are necessary for a "minimal" interface to the build engine.
    A full "native Python" SCons environment has gotten pretty heavyweight
    with all of the methods and Tools and construction variables we've
    jammed in there, so it would be nice to have a lighter weight
    alternative for interfaces that don't need all of the bells and
    whistles.  (At some point, we'll also probably rename this class
    "Base," since that more reflects what we want this class to become,
    but because we've released comments that tell people to subclass
    Environment.Base to create their own flavors of construction
    environment, we'll save that for a future refactoring when this
    class actually becomes useful.)

    Special note: methods here and in actual child classes might be called
    via proxy from an :class:`OverrideEnvironment`, which isn't in the
    class inheritance chain. Take care that methods called with a *self*
    that's really an ``OverrideEnvironment`` don't make bad assumptions.

    Note: as currently constituted, this class is not useful standalone,
    except for unit tests (the only things that ever instantiate one).
    There is at least one method (:meth:`MergeFlags`) that calls methods that
    don't exist here (:meth:`~Base.Append`, :meth:`~Base.AppendUnique`,
    and :meth:`~Split`) that are left to derived classes - :class:`Base`).
    A brief experiment in moving ``MergeFlags``
    broke things as it's part of how an environment is initialized.
    It doesn't seen worthwhile to refactor this separation.

       tools: list of tools to initialize.
       toolpath: list of paths to search for tools.

    """A proxy that implements override environments.

    Returns attributes/methods and construction variables from the
    base environment *subject*, except that same-named construction
    variables from *overrides* are returned on read access; assignment
    to a construction variable creates an override entry - *subject* is
    not modified. This is a much lighter weight approach for limited-use
    setups than cloning an environment, for example to handle a builder
    call with keyword arguments that make a temporary change to the
    current environment::

        env.Program(target="foo", source=sources, DEBUG=True)

    While the majority of methods are proxied from the underlying environment
    class, enough plumbing is defined in this class for it to behave
    like an ordinary Environment without the caller needing to know it is
    "special" in some way.  We don't call the initializer of the class
    we're proxying, rather depend on it already being properly set up.

    Deletion is handled specially, if a variable was explicitly deleted,
    it should no longer appear to be in the env, but we also don't want to
    modify the subject environment.

    :class:`OverrideEnvironment` can nest arbitratily, *subject*
    can be an existing instance. Although instances can be
    instantiated directly, the expected use is to call the
    :meth:`~SubstitutionEnvironment.Override` method as a factory.

    Note Python does not give us a way to assure the subject environment
    is not modified. Assigning to a variable creates a new entry in
    the override, but moditying a variable will first fetch the one
    from the subject, and if mutable, it will just be modified in place.
    For example: ``over_env.Append(CPPDEFINES="-O")``, where ``CPPDEFINES``
    is an existing list or :class:`~SCons.Util.CLVar`, will successfully
    append to ``CPPDEFINES`` in the subject env.  To avoid such leakage,
    clients such as Scanners, Emitters and Action functions called by a
    Builder using override syntax must take care if modifying an env
    (which is not advised anyway) in case they were passed an
    ``OverrideEnvironment``.
