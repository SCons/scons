Functions for Microsoft Visual C/C++.

The _reset method is used to restore MSVC module data structures to their
initial state for testing purposes.

The _verify method is used as a sanity check that MSVC module data structures
are internally consistent.

Currently:
* _reset is invoked from reset_installed_vcs in the vc module.
* _verify is invoked from the last line in the vc module.
