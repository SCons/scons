"""The SCons Warnings framework.

Enables issuing warnings in situations where it is useful to alert
the user of a condition that does not warrant raising an exception
that could terminate the program.

A new warning class should inherit (perhaps indirectly) from one of
two base classes: :exc:`SConsWarning` or :exc:`WarningOnByDefault`,
which are the same except warnings derived from the latter will start
out in an enabled state. Enabled warnings cause a message to be
printed when called, disabled warnings are silent.

There is also a hierarchy for indicating deprecations and future
changes: for these, derive from :exc:`DeprecatedWarning`,
:exc:`MandatoryDeprecatedWarning`, :exc:`FutureDeprecatedWarning`
or :exc:`FutureReservedVariableWarning`.

Whether or not to display warnings, beyond those that are on by
default, is controlled through the command line (``--warn``) or
through ``SetOption('warn')``.  The names used there use a different
naming style than the warning class names. :func:`process_warn_strings`
converts the names before enabling/disabling.

The behavior of issuing only a message (for "enabled" warnings) can
be toggled to raising an exception instead by calling the
:func:`warningAsException` function.

For new/removed warnings, the manpage needs to be kept in sync.
Any warning class defined here is accepted, but we don't want to make
people have to dig around to find the names.  Warnings do not have to
be defined in this file, though it is preferred: those defined elsewhere
cannot use the enable/disable functionality unless they monkeypatch the
warning into this module's namespace.

You issue a warning, either in SCons code or in a build project's
SConscripts, by calling the :func:`warn` function defined in this module.
Raising directly with an instance of a warning class bypasses the
framework and it will behave like an ordinary exception.
