<cvar name ="_concat">
<summary>
<para>
A function used to produce variables like &cv-_CPPINCFLAGS;. It takes
four or five
arguments: a prefix to concatenate onto each element, a list of
elements, a suffix to concatenate onto each element, an environment
for variable interpolation, and an optional function that will be
called to transform the list before concatenation.

<cvar name="_CPPDEFFLAGS">
<summary>
<para>
An automatically-generated construction variable
containing the C preprocessor command-line options
to define values.
The value of &cv-_CPPDEFFLAGS; is created
by respectively prepending and appending
&cv-CPPDEFPREFIX; and &cv-CPPDEFSUFFIX;
to the beginning and end
of each definition in &cv-CPPDEFINES;.
</para>

<cvar name="CPPDEFINES">
<summary>
<para>
A platform independent specification of C preprocessor definitions.
The definitions will be added to command lines

which is constructed according to
the type of value of &cv-CPPDEFINES;:
</para>

<para>
If &cv-CPPDEFINES; is a string,
the values of the
&cv-CPPDEFPREFIX; and &cv-CPPDEFSUFFIX;
construction variables
will be respectively prepended and appended to the beginning and end

of each element in the list.
If any element is a list or tuple,
then the first item is the name being
defined and the second item is its value:

the values of the
&cv-CPPDEFPREFIX; and &cv-CPPDEFSUFFIX;

The key of each dictionary item
is a name being defined
to the dictionary item's corresponding value;
if the value is
<literal>None</literal>,
then the name is defined without an explicit value.
Note that the resulting flags are sorted by keyword
to ensure that the order of the options on the
command line is consistent each time
&scons;

The list of directories that the C preprocessor will search for include
directories. The C/C++ implicit dependency scanner will search these
directories for include files. Don't explicitly put include directory

<cvar name="LIBPATH">
<summary>
<para>
The list of directories that will be searched for libraries.
The implicit dependency scanner will search these
directories for include files. Don't explicitly put include directory
arguments in &cv-LINKFLAGS; or &cv-SHLINKFLAGS;
because the result will be non-portable
and the directories will not be searched by the dependency scanner. Note:
directory names in LIBPATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript
directory when they are used in a command. To force
&scons;

which is constructed by
respectively prepending and appending the values of the

<scons_function name="DefaultEnvironment">
<arguments signature="global">
([**kwargs])
</arguments>
<summary>
<para>
Instantiates and returns the default &consenv; object.
The &defenv; is used internally by SCons
in order to execute many of the global functions in this list
(that is, those not called as methods of a specific &consenv;).
It is not mandatory to call &f-DefaultEnvironment;:
the &defenv; will be instantiated automatically when the
build phase begins if the function has not been called,
however calling it explicitly gives the opportunity to
affect and examine the contents of the &defenv;.
</para>
<para>
The &defenv; is a singleton, so the keyword
arguments affect it only on the first call, on subsequent
calls the already-constructed object is returned and
any keyword arguments are silently ignored.
The &defenv; can be modified after instantiation
in the same way as any &consenv;.
Modifying the &defenv; has no effect on the &consenv;
constructed by an &f-link-Environment; or &f-link-Clone; call.
