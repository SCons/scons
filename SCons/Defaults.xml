<cvar name ="_concat">
<summary>
    <para>
        A function used to produce variables like &cv-link-_CPPINCFLAGS;. It takes
        four mandatory arguments, and up to 4 additional optional arguments:
        1) a prefix to concatenate onto each element,
        2) a list of elements,
        3) a suffix to concatenate onto each element,
        4) an environment for variable interpolation,
        5) an optional function that will be called to transform the list before concatenation,
        6) an optionally specified target (Can use TARGET),
        7) an optionally specified source (Can use SOURCE),
        8) optional <parameter>affect_signature</parameter> flag which will wrap non-empty returned value with $( and $) to indicate the contents
        should not affect the signature of the generated command line.

<cvar name="_CPPDEFFLAGS">
<summary>
<para>
An automatically-generated &consvar;
containing the C preprocessor command-line options
to define values.
The value of &cv-link-_CPPDEFFLAGS; is created
by respectively prepending and appending
&cv-link-CPPDEFPREFIX; and &cv-link-CPPDEFSUFFIX;
to each definition in &cv-link-CPPDEFINES;.
</para>
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="CPPDEFINES">
<summary>
<para>
A platform independent specification of C preprocessor macro definitions.
The definitions are added to command lines
through the automatically-generated
&cv-link-_CPPDEFFLAGS; &consvar;,
which is constructed according to
the contents of &cv-CPPDEFINES;:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
If &cv-CPPDEFINES; is a string,
the values of the
&cv-link-CPPDEFPREFIX; and &cv-link-CPPDEFSUFFIX; &consvars;
are respectively prepended and appended to
each definition in &cv-CPPDEFINES;,
split on whitespace.
</para>

<example_commands>
# Adds -Dxyz to POSIX compiler command lines,
# and /Dxyz to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines.
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES='xyz')
</example_commands>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
If &cv-CPPDEFINES; is a list,
the values of the
&cv-CPPDEFPREFIX; and &cv-CPPDEFSUFFIX; &consvars;
are respectively prepended and appended to
each element in the list.
If any element is a tuple (or list)
then the first item of the tuple is the macro name
and the second is the macro definition.
If the definition is not omitted or <literal>None</literal>,
the name and definition are combined into a single
<literal>name=definition</literal> item
before the preending/appending.
</para>

<example_commands>
# Adds -DB=2 -DA to POSIX compiler command lines,
# and /DB=2 /DA to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines.
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES=[('B', 2), 'A'])
</example_commands>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
If &cv-CPPDEFINES; is a dictionary,
the values of the
&cv-CPPDEFPREFIX; and &cv-CPPDEFSUFFIX; &consvars;
are respectively prepended and appended to
each key from the dictionary.
If the value for a key is not <literal>None</literal>,
then the key (macro name) and the value
(macros definition) are combined into a single
<literal>name=definition</literal> item
before the prepending/appending.
</para>

<example_commands>
# Adds -DA -DB=2 to POSIX compiler command lines,
# or /DA /DB=2 to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines.
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES={'B':2, 'A':None})
</example_commands>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
Depending on how contents are added to &cv-CPPDEFINES;,
it may be transformed into a compound type,
for example a list containing strings, tuples and/or dictionaries.
&SCons; can correctly expand such a compound type.
</para>

<para>
Note that &SCons; may call the compiler via a shell.
If a macro definition contains characters such as spaces that
have meaning to the shell, or is intended to be a string value,
you may need to use the shell's quoting syntax to avoid
interpretation by the shell before the preprocessor sees it.
Function-like macros are not supported via this mechanism
(and some compilers do not even implement that functionality
via the command lines).
When quoting, note that
one set of quote characters are used to define a &Python; string,
then quotes embedded inside that would be consumed by the shell
unless escaped.  These examples may help illustrate:
</para>

<example_commands>
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES=['USE_ALT_HEADER=\\"foo_alt.h\\"'])
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES=[('USE_ALT_HEADER', '\\"foo_alt.h\\"')])
</example_commands>

<para>
:<emphasis>Changed in version  4.5</emphasis>:
&SCons; no longer sorts &cv-CPPDEFINES; values entered
in dictionary form.  &Python; now preserves dictionary
keys in the order they are entered, so it is no longer
necessary to sort them to ensure a stable command line.

<cvar name="CPPDEFPREFIX">
<summary>

The prefix used to specify preprocessor macro definitions

An automatically-generated &consvar;

&cv-link-INCPREFIX; and &cv-link-INCSUFFIX;

</para>
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="CPPPATH">
<summary>
<para>
The list of directories that the C preprocessor will search for include
directories. The C/C++ implicit dependency scanner will search these
directories for include files. 
In general it's not advised to put include directory directives
directly into &cv-link-CCFLAGS; or &cv-link-CXXFLAGS;
as the result will be non-portable
and the directories will not be searched by the dependency scanner.
&cv-CPPPATH; should be a list of path strings,
or a single string, not a pathname list joined by
Python's <systemitem>os.sep</systemitem>.
</para>

<para>
Note:
directory names in &cv-CPPPATH;
will be looked-up relative to the directory of the SConscript file
when they are used in a command. 
To force &scons;
to look-up a directory relative to the root of the source tree use 
the <literal>#</literal> prefix:
</para>

<example_commands>
env = Environment(CPPPATH='#/include')
</example_commands>

<para>
The directory look-up can also be forced using the
&f-link-Dir;

</para>

<example_commands>
include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(CPPPATH=include)

the <literal>#</literal> prefix:

construction variable,
which is constructed by
respectively prepending and appending the values of the
&cv-link-LIBDIRPREFIX; and &cv-link-LIBDIRSUFFIX;

Any command lines you define that need

</para>

<para>
String-valued library names should include
only the library base names,
without prefixes such as <filename>lib</filename>
or suffixes such as <filename>.so</filename> or <filename>.dll</filename>.
The library list will be added to command lines
through the automatically-generated
&cv-_LIBFLAGS; &consvar;
which is constructed by
respectively prepending and appending the values of the
&cv-LIBLINKPREFIX; and &cv-LIBLINKSUFFIX; &consvars;

Library name strings should not include a
path component, instead the compiler will be
directed to look for libraries in the paths
specified by &cv-link-LIBPATH;.

Any command lines you define that need
the &cv-LIBS; library list should

</para>

<example_commands>

<para>
If you add a
<classname>File</classname>
object to the
&cv-LIBS;
list, the name of that file will be added to
&cv-_LIBFLAGS;,

&cv-LIBLINKPREFIX;

&cv-LIBLINKSUFFIX;.
For example:
</para>

<example_commands>

<scons_function name="DefaultEnvironment">

<summary>
<para>
Instantiates and returns the default &consenv; object.
The &defenv; is used internally by SCons
in order to execute many of the global functions in this list
(that is, those not called as methods of a specific &consenv;).
It is not mandatory to call &f-DefaultEnvironment;:
the &defenv; will be instantiated automatically when the
build phase begins if the function has not been called,
however calling it explicitly gives the opportunity to
affect and examine the contents of the &defenv;.
</para>
<para>
The &defenv; is a singleton, so the keyword
arguments affect it only on the first call, on subsequent
calls the already-constructed object is returned and
any keyword arguments are silently ignored.
The &defenv; can be modified after instantiation
in the same way as any &consenv;.
Modifying the &defenv; has no effect on the &consenv;
constructed by an &f-link-Environment; or &f-link-Clone; call.
